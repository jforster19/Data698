9238,"We just need a new term to refer to New Money. ""Blue bloods"" specifically refers to teams with historical dominance across every statistical category. 


If we want a way to compare schools over shorter periods of time and give more weight to recent success we can absolutely do that, but we need a new term, ""blue blood"" is NOT the way to describe the best current teams or best teams of the last 20-30 years.",,

Some solid seasons in the 1940s but then not a ton until the Richardson era - which was AWESOME - but then a pretty big drop off by your standards until the Muss Bus / whatever the coach Cal era will be.

9256,"Agreed!

With your MSU flair, I'm wondering what you think of my assessment of your program.  Izzo's run has been amazing, it is shocking he only has one title.  Feels a little like Roy never getting a title at Kansas level of shock.",MSU; Izzo; Roy; Kansas,Team; Coach; Coach; Team
9257,"I disagree.  Prior to coach K their success was not sustained.  Their first final four was 1963, after every old money team had won at least 1 NCAA title or multiple titles if you go pre-NCAA.  Between their magical 1977 run and their 1965 successful season they were pretty lousy.  Over those 12 years UCLA basically had its whole dynasty AND in-state rival NC state won.  It is arguable that until coach K turned things in the mid 1980s, Duke was the third best program in its own state.

As for Gonzaga they are up to 26 NCAA appearances since just 1995, 9 straight sweet 16s, and have 2 runner ups.

To compare pre 1991 Duke and current Gonzaga:

Duke pre 1991: 0 titles, 4 runner-ups, 8 Final Fours, 10 E8s, 11 S16s

Gonzaga: current: 0 titles, 2 runner-ups, 2 Final Fours, 6 E8s, 14 S16s",K; UCLA; NC State; Gonzaga; Duke,Coach; Team; Team; Team; Team
9258,True...to an extent.  The era between Ward Lambert (1918-1945) and Coach Keady (1980-2005) is pretty lean.  But that puts a lot of pressure on those two pre-NCAA titles from the 1930s to hold up historically.  They make sense for Kentucky or Kansas since they mark the start of an unprecedented era.  For Purdue they kind of feel like Wyoming's 1943 NCAA title 1934 Helms title.  Great for history but doesn't impact my personal historical rankings here in 2024.,Ward Lambert; Keady;  Kentucky; Kansas; Purdue; Wyoming,Coach; Coach; Team; Team; Team; Team

Vic Bubas was an individual fantastic coach but Duke didn't have sustained high-level success before or after him like the Old Money teams did throughout that era.

The vast majority of the fan base has had his back during all this due to his success in his first 9 years here. We have just wanted him to adapt to the changes in the sport the last few years because his way of doing things hasn't been working the same way anymore.

I could do that for two days a week, and maybe even three for how perfect the job was, but they were so locked in on it and it was apparently because they’d had a guy working another job on them.

There were serious talks about firing him after 2011, but I think the fact that Zeller signed on gave the admin hope that something would work out. Plus, since our admin wanted to play goody two shoes, we were still on probation until after the 2011 season. 

If we *had* fired Crean after 2010, you're right that we would've had our best chance to get Stevens to Bloomington. However, I don't know how long he would've stayed. 5 years max? But I guess at that point, our program would probably have been much more consistent. 

Personally, I think most coaches could've gotten Indiana back to a consistent tournament team after Sampson, but it would've taken most coaches at least 3 years.

9896,"there is a small contingent of Kentucky fans who post on here who are basically ""pick me"" fans. All they can do is bitch about the realistic expectations 90% of the fanbase has for consistent tournament success of sweet 16 or better most seasons and be all doom and gloom",Kentucky,Team

9909,Kentucky AD and Calipari himself already announced hours ago. Arkansas set to announce tomorrow morning.,Kentucky; Calipari,Team; Coach
9910,lotta losers in our fanbase unfortunately,,
9911,Wow what a queef you are,,
9912,He could always go to the ACC.  That coast is nationwide.,ACC,Conference
9913,"Yep. From Jersey City, has always coached in the northeast, aging father still in NJ. His brother went to AZ though so who knows",,
9914,"Plus he’s had major stress problems in the past and is finally at a point where it’s manageable, hard to imagine he would go to a new program and start completely from scratch. And he takes his wife’s opinion into account and by all indications it seems like she does not want to move to Kentucky",Kentucky,Team
9915,"If I had a dollar for every time I’ve heard “he’s an east coast guy through and through” the last 24 hours, I would be rich",,
9916,I hate to tell you this buddy but I live in Kentucky and I don’t think we are located on the west coast,,
9917,It almost happened in the nineties...,,
9918,I was gonna say the transfer portal also makes it *harder* because it increases parity amongst the top teams? Or am I crazy? Does it swing both ways,,
9919,Would rather live in Kentucky than Alabama,,
9920,"Oh I know. But I’d be much more worried about Bruce leaving to to UCLA than UK, because weird things like, “my wife always wanted a house in Santa Monica” start coming up. I’m just saying it’s not most people’s dreams to live in Kentucky or Alabama, and while the jobs are great, you don’t have to worry about the extracurricular draws like a school like USC or UCLA has.",Bruce; UCLA; UK; USC,Coach; Team; Team; Team
9921,">He’s also almost 60.

This makes me feel really old. How is he 58. Where did the time go? I remember him as Billy the Kid.",Billy the Kid,Coach
9922,You make it sound like that is old!  I resemble that!,,
9923,"Eh, he had an ""old man yells at cloud"" moment about how the game has changed from his repeat to our (at the time potential) repeat sometime last week.",,
9924,"I mean, do they even do interviews in the way that people conceive of interviews.  The school's people talk to the coach's people and by the time people are in actually in room together the deal is practically done.",,
9925,Greg Popovich,,
9926,"Personally, there are only two names that I'll be over the moon for (like we were getting Cal): Wright and Hurley. 

Everyone else is pure wait-and-see or disappointment.",Cal; Wright; Hurley,Coach; Coach; Coach
9927,"he wont fail, but there is fear that he has a ceiling of the following:

> get to sweet16 often, every few years elite 8, and once in his tenure he will get to championship to win it all... but he will also lose in the first weekend as many times as he gets to the elite 8

thats good, and better than our last 4 years. but it isn't the Kentucky standard.",Kentucky,Team
9928,"Seems like the type that would melt under the pressure, Oats too tbf.

It's great he made a big turnaround from literally a death penalty ending in a title. But Kentucky basketball isn't in need of something like that. Just feels like a bit of a step sideways/backwards, a la Indiana hiring Mike Woodson.",Oats; Kentucky; Indiana; Mike Woodson,Coach; Team; Team; Coach
9929,Either way he deserves that $$$,,
9930,He deserves a 20% raise at least,,
9931,The reported amount UK is prepared to offer is in the $12Mil per year range.  Dunno if that's true but 'insiders' are saying the money is there for it.,UK,Team
9932,Small schools sure. Kentucky’s going to be the major reason UConn gives him a blank check.,Kentucky; UConn,Team; Team
9933,Hurley shouldn’t reset it. Every AD should say “sure we will give you Dan Hurley money when you win back to back titles.”,Hurley; Dan Hurley,Coach; Coach
9934,"A program that offers a gold standard coach silver standard pay, when a program that’s “a shell of its former self” will, won’t be great for long! Everyone wants to be payed adequately for the work they’re doing, and loyalty is a two way street…

![gif](giphy|BoC8nVlu3oNRsBJw30)

How much (literally) do you think your coaches loyalty is worth taking advantage of? What’s the discount you feel UConn is entitled to?!

Edit- WELL?! How much?!",,
9935,I hate Kentucky and this is still dumb.,Kentucky,Team
9936,Absolutely 0% shot Hurley leaves unless offered 3x by Kentucky.,Hurley; Kentucky,Coach; Team
9937,Teetotaler Mitch,,
9938,"Only thing that would be nice is if Drew fails, they both get canned.",Drew,Coach
9939,"And also, while I have a lot of respect for coach Drew, when looking at his overall tournament history, it doesn't exactly look like something UK fans would love. A lot of early exits. One title. Now maybe at UK he can recruit better and be more consistently great, but I'd definitely be hesitating if I were him knowing if I had the stretch of tourney results in the mid 2010s at UK the fanbase would want my head on a pike",Drew; UK,Coach; Team
9940,Kind of need that big ego to succeed at Kentucky or even the other blue bloods,Kentucky,Team
9941,"Outside of Roy Williams going from Kansas to UNC, coaches just don't make the kinds of moves our fans are expecting.  Even UNC and Duke both promoted assistants this last time.",Roy Williams; Kansas; UNC; Duke,Coach; Team; Team; Team
9942,He's clearing out the snow cone machines,,
9943,Apparently Cal hasn't even informed UK he's leaving yet. Its being reported Cal hasn't even spoken to the UK AD yet.,Cal; UK,Coach; Team
9944,"If Tom Crean ends up as the next head coach of uk  basketball, that might just make the past 8(? I don’t even remember anymore) years worth it",Tom Crean; uk,Coach; Team
9945,"Talk about cherry-picking. The 2019-20 tournament was canceled, or Arizona would have gotten in (19th KP) and the 2020-21 team had a self-imposed ban (29th KP). But way to make it sound like the teams were bad lol",Arizona,Team
9946,"It’s always cool to get a former player but we’re talking about Kentucky here, there’s not a large margin for error",Kentucky,Team
9947,"Cal has scorched the earth everywhere he's been, so it's completely on brand.",Cal,Coach
9948,Pulling lineman will revolutionize the game.,,
9949,People acting like a top 15 Kentucky team is a rebuild of any kind is wild,Kentucky,Team
9950,"Again, I acknowledged he'd rather be in the NBA. But if he gets fired and can't get another gig, which is not at all outside the realm of possibility, he's either coming back to college or going into early retirement.",,
9951,"Nah Billy’s days in the NBA were numbered when he couldn’t win with Kevin Durant, NBA for some reason just loves recycling coaches so who knows maybe he’d get another job but I don’t really know why when he’s already proven he can’t reach the level needed for an nba championship when he was at OKC",Billy; Kevin Durant,Coach; Player
9952,"For his roster, he kind of underperformed at Oklahoma City and they parted ways with him (not technically fired but intentionally not renewed). I just figured being asked to leave 2 out of 2 NBA coaching jobs would make finding a third team a fair bit harder. But he might have enough juice left on his credentials to get one more shot at another team. I just think his situation in the NBA makes his chances of taking the UK job higher than the other absolute hail mary options.",UK,Team
9953,"He would fall apart without Andrea. Dan is a brilliant basketball coach, but he is a barely functional adult in every other way. There are like 9 people in the world who could have made it work married to Dan Hurley, and Andrea is one of them (and the other 8 also all went to Seton Hall).",Dan; Dan Hurley; Seton Hall,Coach; Coach; Team
9954,In a league that lets like 75% of teams in the playoffs. But I get your point,,
9955,"With a losing record, and a losing record overall in his four years there.",,
9956,"Hahahaha its entirely true tho. The number of people who thought they could just dump Cal and get whoever they want is just absurd.  Like Ive seen people say 'Drews not good enough, we are Kentucky.'  


They legit thought anyone and everyone would be clamoring to coach here after what just happened to a HoF coach that a lot of other coaches seem to respect.  Even better is they did the same thing to Tubby Smith.  You inherently know youre walking into a pressure cooker where everyone is at your throat, and now you have the joys of social media too! Wee!",Cal; Drews; Kentucky,Coach; Coach; Team
9957,"He had a tough enough time keeping players around for a second year at UK. Kinda makes me think if anyone is transferring from UK it'll not be to Arkansas with Cal, especially if he's bringing incoming freshman with him",UK; Arkansas; Cal,Team; Team; Coach
9958,"he's attempting to drag his entire roster. There is reporting about JQ not wanting to go to Arkansas and wanting to stay at Kentucky and Karter Knox has reopened his recruitment and his father has specifically said he will consider Kentucky and other schools as well as Arkansas

There is speculation that Klutch and others aren't wild about Arkansas",JQ; Arkansas; Kentucky; Karter Knox,Player; Team; Team; Player
9959,"Hoping the UK AD is working back channels as well. I doubt the AD can recruit, though.",UK,Team
9960,"Y'all are just so entitled. I mean, this is Kentucky football, not… oh, nevermind
/s",Kentucky,Team
9961,How dare fans wanna SEC tourney win,SEC,Conference
9962,"Over the last 5 years, you say? C'mon now. You know perfectly well there was no post-season 5 years ago due to COVID-19. So why hang that around Calipari's neck? He had just as many post-season wins in 2020 and 2021 as Coach K did (see how technical truths can be deceptive?). Let's remember that UK won the SEC in 2020 and was widely considered a Final Four caliber team. It was unequivocally a good season. And yet, the ugly wing of the fanbase uses it to crucify their coach. Okay, you got what you wanted. Now what? The NCAA has found Drew (and Sampson and the liar Pearl) guilty of major recruiting infractions, and it wasn't just one instance. Is Kentucky desperate enough to overlook such a record?",Calpari; K; UK; SEC; Drew; Sampson;Pearl; Kentucky,Coach; Coach; Team; Conference; Coach;Coach; Coach; Team
9963,"Hurley and Drew both make $5M. Kentucky will double that. Self is at $9.6M, Kentucky isn’t gonna offer much more than that. I honestly don’t think Drew or Hurley will take the job, but they’re both worth kicking the tires on. “Hey, do you want to come to a more prestigious job and double your salary?” isn’t as easy to decline as some would have you think. Although, admittedly, the prestige increase isn’t very big over UConn, and Hurley could probably leverage a Kentucky offer into a better UConn salary. Hence Hurley being extremely unlikely.",Hurley; Drew; Kentucky; Self; UConn,Coach; Coach; Team; Coach; Team
9964,I’m sorry,,
9965,"I guess the thought is UK could offer more than UConn. I have no clue if that's true, but they could probably double what Hurley is currently paid. Reasonable UK fans know it's less than a 1% chance but it feels like due diligence that has to be done.",UK; UConn; Hurley,Team; Team; Coach
9966,"Hey, you two get a room!

As a Gen X Vols fan, I’m always ready to roll the clock back to the ‘90s. I wanna see Rick Pitino 2.0. Make L’Ville wish they’d had the balls. /s",Vols; Rick Pitino; L'Ville,Team; Coach; Team
9967,Payne's interviews this year reminded me so much of Cal that it was hilarious. He had all of the arrogance of a high-level coach with none of the skill.,Payne; Cal,Coach; Coach
9968,That was so satisfying. All those fucking smug Washington fans melting down and going from worshipping DeBoer as their new messiah to calling him a fraud basically overnight was amazing and hilarious.,Washington; DeBoer,Team; Coach
9969,He’s apparently not hiding. He was at Dunkin this morning.,,
9970,What? He's been there two years and there was significant year over year improvement.,,
9971,"Quote from older UK media guy (Dick Gabriel) on Cal/Arky talks:

No idea if it's true.",UK; Cal; Arky,Team; Coach; Team
9972,His contract states he cannot talk to any other team without notifying UK. Issue would be proving he actually did but with this report coming out there has to be a trail.,UK,Team
9973,He has not officially taken the job,,
9974,"I'm sure there's business logic behind it, but I absolutely hate seeing g league teams move to the same city as an NBA team. Smaller cities being able to have their own teams are a really fun aspect of minor leagues. Kids all throughout the state of Delaware love going to Blue rocks and bluecoats games which are our minor league teams.  When teams just move to the exact same city it feels more like the equivalent of an NFL practice squad",,
9975,They can get tips from the MLB on how to make cheap looking jerseys,,
9976,Two years definitely feels like five....,,
9977,If it gets his basketball terrorism out of the ACC I’m on board,ACC,Conference

9981,"UK is starting to get used to getting bounced from the first round of the tournament, so it might just work out.",UK,Team
9982,That would be hilarious.,,
9983,No. Hard no.,,
9984,Huh?  I wanna make sure I’m reading this right.  Heup got us to the #1 ranking in the playoffs (don’t wanna talk about it beyond that ok?) and beat Bama AND fLorida in the same year. I’m ecstatic with him so far,Heup; Bama; fLorida,Coach; Team; Team
9985,No. Consider those the early Butch Jones years,Butch Jones,Coach
9986,Personally I want Shohei Ohtani. I think he would be a good fit here.,,
9987,"UK fans are, unfortunately, the reason that very few coaches will want the job. You have to have an arrogant streak approaching a god-complex to put up with the expectations and constant criticism.",UK,Team
9988,Indiana has more tournament wins in the last 5 years. A fun fact.,Indiana,Team
9989,"Just remember, it could always be worse. Even when you guys do have to rebuild, it usually only takes 1-2 years. If you were an average program, you'd be staring down a 5-6 year rebuild every time a coach leaves.",,
9990,I’m just a mid-major but very much enjoying this for obvious reasons,,
9991,"I’m not going to pretend to know anything about how an NBA org is run, but being a GM definitely seems like a lot less work than being a HC.",,
9992,He’s even Transportation Secretary,,
9993,"He really is one of the greatest basketball
minds to grace the sport",,
9994,That’s crazy considering they let a black man go on tv everyday and blabber about shit they have no business blabbering about (talking about Stephen A),,
9995,The Eastern Conference is a tire fire though. The 2 seed may not even get to 50 wins.,,
9996,"You people need to stop giving a shit what Stephen Smith has to say about anything. He only says shit to get views. It's best to just ignore him totally. Change the channel when he's on tv, don't watch his shows and don't engage on any article or anything he says, even if it's to voice your displeasure.",,
9997,Learn how to spell and I might do that.,,
9998,Maybe we could pay a coach 700 million and just defer the payments for 30 years lol.,,

10012,"Considering those two names are impossibilities, looks like you guys will be in wait-and-see mode.",,
10013,"Yes, losing in the first round isn’t Kentucky standard, and going to the second weekend of the tournament is the floor for fan expectations. However if we’re consistently one of the best 10 teams going into the tournament most years, then I think Kentucky fans would be happy with making it to the sweet 16/ elite 8 with a decent shot to make the final 4 most years. I don’t see why any Kentucky fan can look at Baylor’s record the last few years and not want that for our team. Of course we’d rather have Hurley, but I just don’t see that happening.",Kentucky; Baylor,Team; Team
10014,Double that. Dude should be making 10 mil a season base for back to back nattys.,,
10015,"On the other hand, UK will end up paying much more for some 2nd tier coach like Scott Drew than he’s worth because they played a role in resetting the market with Hurley.",UK; Scott Drew; Hurley,Team; Coach; Coach
10016,The state of CT said they’ll give UConn the money to match whatever another school offers. He won’t be taking a discount.,UConn,Team
10017,"Kentucky doesn’t have enough to poach Hurley.  A program in shambles.  An angry, entitled fanbase.  Danny would have to live in (eww) Kentucky.  LOL try scouting the mid-majors.",Kentucky; Hurley,Team; Coach
10018,Six National Championships and counting.  Try to keep up Dukies.,Dukies,Team
10019,"I think the real question is who can they get that is better? It now seems like Oats and Hurley are off the table, Drew seems like a decent third option after those two.

If I were them I would try to get Rick Pitino on a year to year contract and see who could be got next year.",Oats; Hurley; Drew; Rick Pitino,Coach; Coach; Coach; Coach
10020,"I think the biggest appeal of Drew was that he took over Baylor when they were by far the worst major conference job in the country, and built them up to a National Championship. Probably the greatest turnaround in CBB history. I guess the thought process is if he can do that there, what can he do with more resources?

Kind of reminds me of when Mike Riley went to Nebraska, but that obviously didn’t turn out so well.",Drew; Baylor; Riley; Nebraska,Coach; Team; Coach; Team
10021,"Yeah, in 22 years he's gotten past the elite eight only once, and only reached the elite eight three times. And his championship was in the weird covid year. Whenever UK fans were complaining about Calipari we were always told by everyone else that his 9-16 year ""didn't count"" because it was that year, but apparently only having one deep run that took place that year isn't supposed to be a cause for concern. 

Granted, coaches generally do better at UK than they have at other schools due to the program's resources, so it could potentially work out fine, but it's at least concerning.",UK; Calipari,Team; Coach
10022,"At Carolina the plan was always to promote from within. We only interviewed assistants and former players. I am not sure if Duke even kicked the tires on anyone else. Maybe a super secret call to Brad Stevens, just to make sure.",Carolina; Duke; Brad Stevens,Team; Team; Coach
10023,So he missed 2 of the last 3 for which he was eligible and which existed.  I withdraw none of the bad things I've said about Sean Miller.,Sean Miller,Coach
10024,"I mean, I can't say that Pope would be a success at Kentucky, but it seems like he should be well aware of the ""fishbowl"" and the recruiting area since he played there. Also, I wouldn't be that worried about local recruiting ties at Kentucky, since they've been recruiting nationally since forever.",Pope; Kentucky,Coach; Team
10025,Sure there is. One title got Cal 15 years.,Cal,Coach
10026,It will be assuming all (or most) of the croots and transfers follow Cal to Fayetteville.,Cal,Coach
10027,"I mean, he only got one year with KD and lost to the 73 win warriors before KD left, so I’m not gonna knock him for that.  He definitely should’ve done better with the Westbrook + George core though.",,
10028,Fair points!,,
10029,"😂😂 that checks out honestly, I can totally see him being the type of guy that is a coaching savant but can't even remember to eat or go to bed or something like that. Sounds like keeping her happy is even more important then!!",,
10030,"12/30 automatically make the playoffs

8/30 make the play-in (doesn’t count as the playoffs)

For 16/30 (53%) in the playoffs and 20/30 (67%) with post regular season play",,
10031,"I think everyone is just waiting for it to be official before flipping honestly. Even if he loses 1 or 2 guys it’s Cal, he’ll get recruits. That’s just what he does is recruit",Cal,Coach
10032,"We definitely have our crazy fans, but a lot of this has to do with Cal's attitude. He refuses to adapt his coaching style, treats anyone who questions him like an idiot, and throws everyone he can under the bus to avoid being held responsible for losses. He has turned things so incredibly toxic inside the program that all of our boosters have abandoned it for football because Stoops is infinitely easier to get along with. Things were falling off the rails quickly, and we all could really start to see it.",Cal; Stoops,Coach; Coach
10033,"Baylor has the financial resources and the willingness to match any offer Drew gets. Kentucky definitely has more historical prestige, but is that worth the risk? If he has 2-3 mediocre seasons without a S16/E8 berth he’ll probably be fired from UK. Not the mention going from somewhere he’s adored to dealing with UK fans",Baylor; Drew; Kentucky; UK,Team; Coach; Team; Team
10034,"This is exactly it, because if the ESPN/SEC deal Kentucky can out bid UConn by a significant margin in terms of both salary, assists pay, facilities, etc. As much as I hate it, CBB is following football and there are going to be two conferences that have significantly more resources than others because of the TV deals. Do I think this will be enough to ultimately sway Dan Hurley? No, but I do think it’s enough to make him consider the job more than people are letting on.",SEC; Kentucky; UConn; Dan Hurley,Conference; Team; Team; Coach
10035,He’s sleeping around,,
10036,"Also, you'd have to prove that this particular breach of contract is worthy of termination (I think). I don't think it's as black and white as any breach of contract is worthy of termination (maybe I'm wrong).",,
10037,Correct. I could be wrong but I thought there was something in the contract about him informing the school if he was in talks with a new job.,,

Kentucky basketball fans have higher standards for a coach than Tennessee football fans do and should have.",Kentucky; Tennessee,Team; Team
10041,You can bet on that,,
10042,Danny Hurley to UK confirmed,Danny Hurley; UK,Coach; Team
10043,"As much as all of what follows makes me want to vomit, Kentucky's history warrants those expectations and arrogance and, were I in your shoes, I'd be just as critical. It's the same story as Alabama football. They clamored for championships after Bear and 8 years later got Stallings. Then they fired Shula after a 6-6 season one year removed from a 10-2 season and got Saban.

As much as I love to give Baylor and Scott Drew shit.... It's ABSOLUTELY the best turnaround in not just college basketball but arguably North American sports.

10060,"Oh absolutely, even as somebody who was raised to hate Baylor by my mom, I have an incredible amount of respect for him and what he did with that program. But I think it's possible that the skills that it took to build a program from nothing are different than the skills needed to excel at a program that already has a lot of sustained success in history. Different programs can require different types of people to succeed. For example, Shaka was great at VCU because his havoc defense was a great recipe for pulling upsets and getting them to the final four. But when he came to Texas and was expected to pull five star recruits and win with that kind of talent, he was not able to deliver. Now I can't really name any specific reasons why I think Scott drew wouldn't succeed at Kentucky per se, but my point is just that much of what made Drew such a great and historic coach wouldn't really be required at Kentucky in the first place",Shaka; VCU; Texas; Scott Drew; Kentucky; Drew,Coach; Team; Team; Coach; Team; Coach

I'd personally try to lure Pitino back for his last 2-3 years to give the AD time to plan the next hire. His previous track record and ""use by"" date mean fans will give him more slack, and I expect he'll be making the Sweet 16 at a minimum.",Pitino,Coach

Uncalled for and unjustified. It's not about ""buying everything,"" but rather that we expect our administration to go all out, do whatever it takes, because we care that much.

I’m saying if duke doesn’t sustain success outside of coach K and win titles without him, they won’t deserve to be considered blue bloods. This is decade plus down the road. Until such times, yes they are a blue blood, for now.",duke; K,Team; Coach
11744,"As a neutral fan of a team with no fantasies of being a blue blood at all, this is the correct take. I would rather be a UConn fan than any other school in this run, obviously. But this is an old game and there’s levels to history here.  UK, UNC, and KU are the top 3, Duke is right there, and UCLA had their time. UConn winning with 3 different coaches is very impressive and helps them punch above their weight, but they’re still at the blue blood kids table",UConn;UK; UNC; KU; Duke; UCLA,Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team
11745,So they'll never get to blue blood even if they win a chip every over year but records are in the gutters in the intermittent years?  Winning it all has to count for something or else we're just chalking it up to luck in a single elimination tourney.,,
11746,"Yeah I was kind of thinking the same thing.

Part of the reason Duke gets so much attention is that we're kind of ""up there"" every year - maybe not a true national title contender every season but it's rare we're worse than about a 4 or 5 seed. Same with Kansas.

UConn has had those weird swings though where they come out of nowhere. Although they're a big-name program, some of their other runs you've mentioned have been those quintessentially March Madness-type of runs where they haven't been favored to do much (the Kemba Walker year comes to mind)",Duke; Kansas; UConn; Kemba Walker,Team; Team; Team; Player

No, it's always been a dumb concept to divide people. But the concept exists as it is, and complaining about the unfairness of blue bloods is the most tautological thing you can do. It's unfair by design. Pitching a fit you aren't part of it is sad because that's exactly what the system is meant for, to tell the successful that they still aren't good enough for reasons they can't change.

I haven’t followed him closely enough to know any specific things he has done to be an asshole on par with those guys, but you have to be kind of be an asshole to be as animated as he is non stop, as if every call against UConn is a hate crime.
