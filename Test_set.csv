9256,"Agreed!

With your MSU flair, I'm wondering what you think of my assessment of your program.  Izzo's run has been amazing, it is shocking he only has one title.  Feels a little like Roy never getting a title at Kansas level of shock.",MSU; Izzo; Roy; Kansas,Team; Coach; Coach; Team
9257,"I disagree.  Prior to coach K their success was not sustained.  Their first final four was 1963, after every old money team had won at least 1 NCAA title or multiple titles if you go pre-NCAA.  Between their magical 1977 run and their 1965 successful season they were pretty lousy.  Over those 12 years UCLA basically had its whole dynasty AND in-state rival NC state won.  It is arguable that until coach K turned things in the mid 1980s, Duke was the third best program in its own state.

As for Gonzaga they are up to 26 NCAA appearances since just 1995, 9 straight sweet 16s, and have 2 runner ups.

To compare pre 1991 Duke and current Gonzaga:

Duke pre 1991: 0 titles, 4 runner-ups, 8 Final Fours, 10 E8s, 11 S16s

Gonzaga: current: 0 titles, 2 runner-ups, 2 Final Fours, 6 E8s, 14 S16s",K; UCLA; NC State; Gonzaga; Duke,Coach; Team; Team; Team; Team
9258,True...to an extent.  The era between Ward Lambert (1918-1945) and Coach Keady (1980-2005) is pretty lean.  But that puts a lot of pressure on those two pre-NCAA titles from the 1930s to hold up historically.  They make sense for Kentucky or Kansas since they mark the start of an unprecedented era.  For Purdue they kind of feel like Wyoming's 1943 NCAA title 1934 Helms title.  Great for history but doesn't impact my personal historical rankings here in 2024.,Ward Lambert; Keady;  Kentucky; Kansas; Purdue; Wyoming,Coach; Coach; Team; Team; Team; Team

Vic Bubas was an individual fantastic coach but Duke didn't have sustained high-level success before or after him like the Old Money teams did throughout that era.

If we *had* fired Crean after 2010, you're right that we would've had our best chance to get Stevens to Bloomington. However, I don't know how long he would've stayed. 5 years max? But I guess at that point, our program would probably have been much more consistent. 

Personally, I think most coaches could've gotten Indiana back to a consistent tournament team after Sampson, but it would've taken most coaches at least 3 years.

9909,Kentucky AD and Calipari himself already announced hours ago. Arkansas set to announce tomorrow morning.,Kentucky; Calipari,Team; Coach
9910,lotta losers in our fanbase unfortunately,,
9911,Wow what a queef you are,,
9912,He could always go to the ACC.  That coast is nationwide.,ACC,Conference
9913,"Yep. From Jersey City, has always coached in the northeast, aging father still in NJ. His brother went to AZ though so who knows",,
9914,"Plus he‚Äôs had major stress problems in the past and is finally at a point where it‚Äôs manageable, hard to imagine he would go to a new program and start completely from scratch. And he takes his wife‚Äôs opinion into account and by all indications it seems like she does not want to move to Kentucky",Kentucky,Team
9915,"If I had a dollar for every time I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúhe‚Äôs an east coast guy through and through‚Äù the last 24 hours, I would be rich",,
9916,I hate to tell you this buddy but I live in Kentucky and I don‚Äôt think we are located on the west coast,,
9917,It almost happened in the nineties...,,
9918,I was gonna say the transfer portal also makes it *harder* because it increases parity amongst the top teams? Or am I crazy? Does it swing both ways,,
9919,Would rather live in Kentucky than Alabama,,
9920,"Oh I know. But I‚Äôd be much more worried about Bruce leaving to to UCLA than UK, because weird things like, ‚Äúmy wife always wanted a house in Santa Monica‚Äù start coming up. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not most people‚Äôs dreams to live in Kentucky or Alabama, and while the jobs are great, you don‚Äôt have to worry about the extracurricular draws like a school like USC or UCLA has.",Bruce; UCLA; UK; USC,Coach; Team; Team; Team

9952,"For his roster, he kind of underperformed at Oklahoma City and they parted ways with him (not technically fired but intentionally not renewed). I just figured being asked to leave 2 out of 2 NBA coaching jobs would make finding a third team a fair bit harder. But he might have enough juice left on his credentials to get one more shot at another team. I just think his situation in the NBA makes his chances of taking the UK job higher than the other absolute hail mary options.",UK,Team

They legit thought anyone and everyone would be clamoring to coach here after what just happened to a HoF coach that a lot of other coaches seem to respect.¬† Even better is they did the same thing to Tubby Smith.¬† You inherently know youre walking into a pressure cooker where everyone is at your throat, and now you have the joys of social media too!

He had just as many post-season wins in 2020 and 2021 as Coach K did (see how technical truths can be deceptive?). Let's remember that UK won the SEC in 2020 and was widely considered a Final Four caliber team. It was unequivocally a good season. And yet, the ugly wing of the fanbase uses it to crucify their coach. Okay, you got what you wanted. Now what? The NCAA has found Drew (and Sampson and the liar Pearl) guilty of major recruiting infractions, and it wasn't just one instance. Is Kentucky desperate enough to overlook such a record?",Calpari; K; UK; SEC; Drew; Sampson;Pearl; Kentucky,Coach; Coach; Team; Conference; Coach;Coach; Coach; Team

I honestly don‚Äôt think Drew or Hurley will take the job, but they‚Äôre both worth kicking the tires on. ‚ÄúHey, do you want to come to a more prestigious job and double your salary?‚Äù isn‚Äôt as easy to decline as some would have you think. Although, admittedly, the prestige increase isn‚Äôt very big over UConn, and Hurley could probably leverage a Kentucky offer into a better UConn salary. Hence Hurley being extremely unlikely.",Hurley; Drew; Kentucky; Self; UConn,Coach; Coach; Team; Coach; Team
9964,I‚Äôm sorry,,
9965,"I guess the thought is UK could offer more than UConn. I have no clue if that's true, but they could probably double what Hurley is currently paid. Reasonable UK fans know it's less than a 1% chance but it feels like due diligence that has to be done.",UK; UConn; Hurley,Team; Team; Coach

As much as I love to give Baylor and Scott Drew shit.... It's ABSOLUTELY the best turnaround in not just college basketball but arguably North American sports.

But I think it's possible that the skills that it took to build a program from nothing are different than the skills needed to excel at a program that already has a lot of sustained success in history. Different programs can require different types of people to succeed. For example, Shaka was great at VCU because his havoc defense was a great recipe for pulling upsets and getting them to the final four. But when he came to Texas and was expected to pull five star recruits and win with that kind of talent, he was not able to deliver. Now I can't really name any specific reasons why I think Scott drew wouldn't succeed at Kentucky per se, but my point is just that much of what made Drew such a great and historic coach wouldn't really be required at Kentucky in the first place",Shaka; VCU; Texas; Scott Drew; Kentucky; Drew,Coach; Team; Team; Coach; Team; Coach
