82,"You can win a conference, but if it's a weak conference, you might still be a lower seed, even a 16 seed. You are guaranteed a spot, but not necessarily a good one. You're almost certainly not one of the top 68 teams in the country if you enter as a 16 seed, but the NCAA still gives you a spot because it makes the tourney more exciting plus a little bit of equal opportunity.

32 conferences all with a guaranteed spot to the winner means there's a gap where a team can be a top 68 or higher team but there's no room left. These are filled by the so-called ""at-large"" bids. Yet the seed should still represent ""how good the team is"" on some level.

Also, although I understand it may be too late at this point, I would like to repeat my suggestion I made leading up to last year's final.

If you're a fan of any other team, including the losing team, teams eliminated earlier in the tournament, and teams who did not make it at all, donate to the foodbank of the winning team.

132,"MONDAY, APRIL 8, 2024

Eric Shero, president of Alliance Bank of Waco and Baylor basketball booster, dips another tortilla chip into his salsa bowl and takes a bite. It's spicier than usual, but with a little bit of a bitter aftertaste. Maybe they overdid the cilantro. ""Man, Scotty, I love this place, but this salsa is working today! I tell you what, you know they don't have salsa like this in Lexington.""

The man sitting opposite Shero in the booth nods, glances up at the TV mounted in the corner over Shero's shoulder. ""Feud's on. You like the Family Feud, Eric?""

Shero blinks uncertainly, then smiles and nods. He likes the Family Feud, right? Steve Harvey? For some reason his thoughts are slipping out of his grasp. ""Sure, I ... I guess so, Scotty. Say, you know, I'm not feeling so good all of a sudden.""  

""Probably just that salsa, Eric. You'll be fine."" The man motions to someone else standing behind the counter. ""Hey look, here's a fan who wants a picture of us together. Smile for the camera, Eric."" Eric's head is swimming. He's unsure now of what exactly is happening, but his instinct, honed from years of corporate glad-handing and big-time athletic boosterism, takes over. He grins and nods. The picture is taken and the photographer slinks out of the restaurant unnoticed. Shero slumps back in the booth. ""Scotty, I ... I think I need to go lay down.""

Scott Drew stands up, leans over Shero, gives him a little pat on the cheek. ""Eric? Eric, listen to me. This is a dream, Eric. You never ate that salsa, we never took that picture, and I was never here. You got that?""

""Never ... here,"" Shero mumbles into his drinks menu.

""That's right. And hey - you helped me out today, big time.  I won't forget it."" And with the photographic evidence of his future alibi secured, Scott Drew leaves the restaurant, headed for an uncertain future. He's surprised by a pang of guilt as he boards his Uber, but quickly dismisses it. ""After all,"" he thinks to himself, ""how many guys would let an opportunity like this slip through their fingers?""

263,"It's hard to remember exactly who rejected us, officially, and when, since we had two searches in a 3-year period.

I remember for certain that Donovan rejected us both times. I think he was the first pick both times.

Once, Jay Wright said no. Izzo listened long enough to get a new contract. Rick Barnes removed his name from consideration (meme - none of us wanted him but he had to get his name in the news). 

We kicked the tires on a lot of names unofficially. Mitch Barnhart really liked Tom Crean and almost no UK fans did. We probably reached out to everyone you'd consider a top 10 coach at the time except K, Roy and Self. The first go-round, Mitch refused to consider Cal (who reportedly would've crawled here). Gillispie got himself the interview and job by beating Pitino in the tourney. Others had said no, I believe, besides the names above. Gillispie was kind of tier 3, I think. There was still a lot of ""Tubby's too nice to have been treated this way"" going around, even though people also no longer considered us elite because of him never getting back to the Final Four, and frankly, getting manhandled by more talented teams. (The Rudy Gay UConn team outclassed us so badly that many of us never forgave Tubby.)

When Gillispie crashed and burned, I don't remember who specifically said no/was being targeted, but Cal was fresh off Derek Rose and then Tyreke Evans, about to bring in the top recruiting class to Memphis, and his stubborn refusal to foul up 3 away from having a ring. (Which the NCAA probably would have been too chicken shit to take away back then. Louisville only lost theirs because of how off the rails they went.)

Even still, Mitch was supposedly forced to hire Cal by boosters. His intro press conference was awkward because one of Mitch's first points was about the compliance protections in the contract (the Rose stuff was big news at the time). 

But outside of people still upset Donovan said no, and those desperate to bring Pitino back, most of us were very happy with Cal. There was a lot of worry over how much smoke he brought from UMass and Memphis, but the NCAA cleared him both times, and once you got to know Cal, he was a good dude. The slimy perception is one that doesn't actually hold up when you get over bias and see how he is in his community.

If not for the probation and taking his recruits, Memphis fans would probably still love Cal.",Donovan; Jay Wright; Izzo; Rick  Barnes; Tom Crean; UK; K; Roy; Self; Cal; Gillespie; Pitino; Rudy Gay; Derek Rose; Tyreke Evans; Louiville,Coach;Coach;Coach; Coach; Coach;Team; Coach;Coach;Coach;Coach;Coach;Coach; Player; Player; Player; Team

Cal's only problem in the transfer portal is guys didn't want to commit to play here when we had possible returnees waiting for draft feedback until the last minute.

>I struggle to call them the top program when they‚Äôre a roller coaster with massive ups and downs

I don't. But hey, you can probably make a case for UNC and Duke too. They have 3 titles in that time frame, and have likely been more consistent beyond that.

756,"Meh, it's pretty true. A lot of people called him ""ten loss Tubby"" as early as 2002. He won people back with a fairly strong three years (though without a final four) then had his two most disappointing seasons, and the talent on the roster was taking a nose dive. His biggest claim to fame was his year 1 championship, but a lot of people give Rick Pitino the credit for that roster. (And it's still true that in his 31 year career he never mad a final four with a team he built.) And from what I've seen a lot of people grumbled throughout his tenure for his ""slow, boring"" brand of basketball. 

I have no doubt Barnhart would have given him another year, but things were definitely starting to heat up and Tubby is not a confrontational guy and decided to get a fresh start elsewhere. 

The thing is the group that was discontent was basically right. He moved to schools with ""lower expectations"" and still managed to get fired twice, and was relegated all the way down to High Point where did even worse than the fired guy he replaced.

You know why Kentucky fans were upset with Tubby? Because we actually watched and analyzed the games and how the program was trending.

Pitino in '96-'97 said he had no interest in the NBA or the Boston Celtics. He went to the Celtics.

Cal told a Memphis reporter on camera that he wasn't interested in the UK job. He took the UK job and called it a dream job.

Hurley said repeatedly in 2018 that he wasn't leaving Rhode Island. He left for UConn.

The only bit of truth we got out of Hurley was the, ""My agent doesn't want me to answer that"" remark on McAfee yesterday.

Hurley very well may stay. Our discussion, that you were adamant in saying it wouldn't happen, was Hurley taking the call and speaking with UK.

He has. He hasn't given them ""No.""

LET ME BE VERY CLEAR.

I don't read that as him coming to UK.

I think this is hearing their offer and seeing if UConn can match or come close. That match could be salary, additional resources and stability. Until he gets that best offer, he's not saying, ""No.""

If he is interested in coming to UK, he's also not going to tell them, ""yes,"" right now with the parade coming up on Saturday. That would leak in a matter of hours and ruin that parade.

1430,"This is the same kind of logic media talking heads are using and that they used when we ran off Tubby. All while acknowledging Duke and UNC were better then and UConn is better now.

> One title, 1 championship loss, two final fours, and three elite eights in fifteen seasons ain‚Äôt winning big?

First, how many times have we heard ""How long has it been since UK won a title?"" We're an elite program, so we hold ourselves to a different standard and compare ourselves to other elites and the hot programs of the moment. We don't have to be as good as UConn or every good team every year. But if all your status rivals (Duke, UNC, Kansas, UConn, even Nova) are reaching multiple Final Fours and titles in the time since you've made the Final Four, it's not good enough.

Cal's first 6 years were phenomenal, and the only way they could've been greater would've been multiple titles. That may sound unreasonable, but multiple other programs and coaches have achieved it, and not just in bygone eras. Donovan went back to back. UConn has crushed it. Roy, Self, K -- all of them did better than Cal since he last made the Final Four. Their consistency outlasted his magical half-decade. Yes, we made a couple elite 8s after that, but he fell short to elite rivals UNC and UConn and in-conference rival Auburn.

And more importantly, since then, he's not just failed to meet the standard others set or he set early on. He's been an embarrassment. Several of our worst losses in history. Our worst season in history. Consecutive losses that broke records. Upset after upset. All while promising this year would be different and blaming his roster, which he built.

And even if you make excuses for a lot of that, or say college basketball is chaotic and you can't expect him to win more (even though I named several above who did in the same span), he's getting paid more than all of those guys except Self. How many years of embarrassments do that title and early Final Fours buy? 

> 
> Your argument is Cal hasn‚Äôt had an elite eight level year in 5 years?
> 
> I guess y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt know Coach K had several bad years in the row a couple times.

And if Cal had multiple titles, believe me, he'd have gotten a lot less criticism and a lot more understanding. He blew so many opportunities, often with weakness everyone saw coming. Yeah, bad runs happen, but when you keep doing the same thing and blame your roster makeup that you built the way you wanted...

> 
> Bill Self took 14 years between his championships, the first of which was stolen from us (and Cal).

How many times did Self miss the tourney in those 14 years? How many historical losses? (I know Kansas had a run of major upsets in the tourney, and it's why Self had a rival-fan reputation as a choke artist til he got his second title.) And how many future NBA stars did he fail to win a title with? Cal boasts about his 50 NBA players from UK. As rival fans point out, he got one title with guys who have become NBA megastars. ""Oh, but they only played one year in college!"" Yeah, we know. But that talent is his whole system, and if other coaches are winning more consistently the last 5+ years with far less talent, why should we let him use that excuse?
> 
> Most of Cal‚Äôs seasons, UK was highly ranked, won most of their games, and just came up short in the NCAA. But Cal is doing something right. It‚Äôs not like his fall off like Tubby Smith like.

His early years were so, so good that many people outside of Lexington are failing to remember how really bad these last four have been. Like worse than Billy G's two years by many standards. 

Cal himself, when he was hired at UK, pointed to Billy G's two year's and Tubby's last few and said that was not the standard expected at or deserved by UK. Cal is no where close to that standard now. The only way he tops anyone these last 4+ years is in recruiting. 

NCAA tourney wins in the last 4 tourneys. 1.

SEC tourney wins in the last 4 tourneys. 1.

Champions Classic wins? Don't remember exactly but it's pretty bad.

Wins against Top 10 opponents. Not good.

Three consecutive losses at home for the first time in program history? Yup.

Upsets at home to 300 net opponent? Yup.

Having to rebuild your roster every year because of the way you recruit and coach? Yup.

I'm not gonna pull up all the statistics (they're easy to find around here and Rupp's Rafters if you want), but Cal post-Covid in particular is a far cry from the Cal who put up all those numbers you're pointing to.

How many more first weekend exits or NIT seasons are we supposed to put up with while he makes $9 million a year and says, ""But look at the NBA draft picks!"" While rival fans mock us year after year?

We don't need titles (NCAA or SEC) every year. We just need to be on the same level as the other top 5 programs in the sport. In return we pay our coach so much and support our program so much.

If gillis started where is the opening for TKR? You saw how few minutes Furst got in the last 10-15 games, that would have been TKR as Gillis would have ended up playing 30+ mpg.  I think Painter played it as well as he could with the hope that TKR could get going early and provide another option if Edey needed a break or if teams couldn't effectively cover both bigs.  I just wish TKR had more to his game to step out and play away from the rim more than he did. He's smaller than Trevion with less creativity/vision/rebounding/scoring.

1721,Absolutely disgusting (but apt) comparison,,
1722,Dr Mason Gillis you say...,Mason Gillis,Player
1723,I wonder if we got to the Portal if a couple more people transfer. Might need some depth in the front court.,,
1724,"I'm confused - someone else said you're over the scholarship limit, so how can you get guys from the portal?",,
1725,There is only 1 with a crappy motel looking inn named after him though. I can't write his name due to blasphemy and possible vomiting inducement.,,
1726,Why wouldn‚Äôt he commit to another year last year?,,
1727,"Yep.¬† This loss has a few people talking nonsensically.¬† For years we all talked about how fickle March is, but one national championship loss and fans are grasping for absurd solutions to overcome it.¬† If UConn had been upset earlier in the tournament, there is a good chance we are the champions instead.¬† Would we be talking about replacing Loyer or Smith then?¬† Absolutely not.¬† Again, March is fickle.


A year ago we were absolutely embarrassed by FDU and Painter ran it back with roughly the same bunch and we just had the most successful season in Purdue basketball history.¬† Thank God Painter isn't as reactionary as some of our fans and didn't burn the house down because of one loss.",UConn; Loyer; Smith; FDU; Painter; Purdue,Team; Player; Player; Team; Coach; Team
1728,Yeah I got ya.,,
1729,I think we just want to see a team that actually plays well together and doesn‚Äôt run around with no plan like the previous couple years. If we get close to the bubble and miss out I think it will show some good progress. Making the tournament would be great but that does seem a step too far with how bare Boynton left us,Boynton,Coach
1730,I agree with this take,,
1731,We‚Äôll have five bigs on the roster next year. I‚Äôm not gonna speculate about who might transfer out but that should be sufficient. Granted we‚Äôre one scholarship over the limit and odds are Painter will be looking to redshirt one of the freshmen,Painter,Coach
1732,Painter was talking in generalities when he said that. We‚Äôre not using the portal this year unless more than expected transfer out,Painter,Coach
1733,"Pretty sure Painter was referring to team building in general. 

You are correct, we are still over the limit by 1. It was known Gillis and Morton wouldn‚Äôt be taking their Covid year at Purdue. Just didn‚Äôt know if they‚Äôd take it somewhere else or call it a career.",Painter; Gillis; Morton; Purdue,Coach; Player; Player; Team
1734,I think that's more of an overarching philosophy rather than specific roster tactics for next season.,,
1735,"No idea. He has been at Purdue for 5 seasons including his redshirt year.  And realistically it's not going to get better next year than it was this year. So maybe he just counts his wins and goes to do something different, change of scenery. Edey/Morton were 2 of his best friends and both are leaving.  And Gillis is wrapping up his MBA so he'd have to choose another grad program next year if he wanted to stick around.


I'm most curious if he goes somewhere like ND to play with Coach Shrews or if he goes to an actual contending team.  Either way he's going to have a huge impact on whatever team he chooses.  1 year of having Gillis can fundamentally shape the following 3-4 years based on his leadership and work ethic.  I'm biased but kinda hoping he chooses UCLA/USC so I can go watch him play out west next season.",Purdue; Morton; Edey; Gillis; ND; Coach Shrew; USC; UCLA,Team; Player; Player; Player; Team; Coach; Team; Team
1736,"I don‚Äôt think he was given the chance. No Purdue guy has stayed for their 5th year. Hunter left, Stefanovic quit, etc. I don‚Äôt think Painter really believes in the 5 years and probably said we‚Äôre just sticking with a normal recruiting cycle.

With Smith, Loyer, Heide, and Colvin already on the team plus Harris and Catchings arriving next year as top 100 recruits, there is *a lot* of competition on the perimeter for playing time, and that's not factoring in Cox or Benter either.

1740,"I didn't know that, I was expecting him to go somewhere he could play.  Good on him for valuing his education, can we convert him to a walk on and pay him NIL money to ride the bench and go to class?",,
1741,I am not implying anyone specific. Just saying we‚Äôre a scholarship over,,
1742,"I don‚Äôt see Waddell transferring. He has some much-needed length at 6‚Äô8 and is pretty athletic so he would probably split minutes at the 4 with Catchings. If he can develop a consistent shot, he would get playing time for sure. His dad is also friends with Painter and also played at Purdue",Waddell; Catchings; Painter; Purdue,Player; Player; Coach; Team
1743,Yeah always a possibility,,
1744,Burgess may be at the 4 with Furst but who knows‚Ä¶a lot will happen in the next few weeks,Burgess; Furst,Player; Player
1745,"You think so? I guess if Painter moves to playing a smaller, faster lineup maybe. However, I foresee TKR, Furst, Berg, Catchings, and Burgess being the ones splitting time at the 4 and 5, and I don't know how much playing time that leaves for Waddell. He will be a junior fighting for being the third or fourth guy on the depth chart for that position.

And I see people bring up the legacy thing with Waddell, but he would hardly be the first legacy recruit to leave the school their parent played for, and Purdue is not the exception in that regard either.",Painter;TKR; Furst; Berg; Catchings;Burgess; Waddell; Purdue,Coach; Player; Player; Player; Player; Player; Player; Team
1746,If that's an actual possibility I'd love to see him and Waddel stay for bench vibes so we can also get a grad transfer ball handling guard so Braden doesn't have to play 38 minutes a game.,Waddel; Smith,Player; Player
1747,Well we would then be at the limit and would need someone else to give up their scholly to then go to the portal,,
1748,"I thought we only need one for the incoming class, but if both Furst and Waddel come of scholarship, doesn't that give us an open spot?",Furst;Waddel,Player; Player
1749,Ah yes if Waddell does same thing. Sorry didn‚Äôt comprehend what you meant with Waddell. You‚Äôd be correct.,Waddell,Player
1750,"I think we're four guys out and five in already, I'll admit I have no idea how redshirts effect this, so we need two more to leave to open a spot for a grad transfer.  Also have no idea if you can just un-scholarship guys, but read somewhere else that in the NIL era scholarship slots don't really matter.  I wonder if our general cautious approach to NIL will keep us from doing things like this if available.",,

So you're had artificially old, skilled rosters filtering out of the game since then. Once that's up the game will trend younger again.

2035,A lot of shitty seniors are out of eligibility,,
2036,"Short answer: We don't, but apparently that doesn't stop us.

Long answer: We have 14 scholarship-level players with eligibility remaining who have yet to enter the portal.

Players from the 2023-24 roster with remaining eligibility: 6

Jordan Butler, Kaleb Brown, Tamar Bates, Trent Pierce, Anthony Robinson, Aidan Shaw

Players who apparently have eligibility left, should they decide to use it (I believe both pending injury waivers for this season): 2 

Caleb Grill, John Tonje

Incoming recruits: 6

Marcus Allen, TO Barrett, Annor Boateng, Trent Burns, Jacob Crews (transfer), Peyton Marshall

So that's 14 players (plus three other traditional walk-ons).

But we've been pretty active in the portal in contacting guys at basically all positions. We've had a couple smaller guards in for visits, we're actively recruiting some bigs, and we've already added a wing player from the portal with more seemingly still being contacted.

It's not clear Brown is even on scholarship at this point, and both Grill and Tonje might be done. We basically had 15 scholarship-equivalent players on this year's roster, so we've shown we can and will use NIL to go past the 13-scholarship max if necessary. (Didn't help much this year, as we lost a few players for the season and sucked as a result.)

There's talk that we'll add as many as five players in the portal, which means we're recruiting for spots that don't exist. Either guys are planning to leave but haven't said anything yet, or our coach is hoping to replace some guys and push them into the portal only after he feels like he has their upgrades in place, which would be unfortunate.

Calipari on the other hand, had a good season where they would have been a 3 seed in the cancelled tournament, a losing season and 3 good, but not great seasons where they lost in the first round twice and the second round once.

Tubby made the tournament every year. Not only that, he never got bounced first round. 6/10 S16, 4/10 E8. His only inferiority (other than recruiting) to Cal was that he only made 1 FF. Tubby did better against teams ranked higher than him than Calipari. He also did good against non-conf P5 schools in comparison to Coach Cal.

Tubby did not recruit well other than the Rondo year, while Cal was the greatest recruiter of all time. Despite Cal's endless NBA talent, they went 76% vs 77% win rate and one championship each. Tubby 5/10 SEC titles, Cal 6/15 SEC titles. As I said before, Tubby has 0 NITs and 0 first round exits. I cannot say that Calipari was better overall without lying. I loved that there were seniors that I got to know over 4 years and got attached to. I miss getting emotional when I saw them get emotional from their successes and failures.

I kept hitting them with his stats, and they did not like it. Billy G was supposed to be twice the coach. LOL. Cal was supposed to embarrass me for being so accepting of ""mediocrity"". Yet his mediocrity took us lower than we have ever seen when Tubby was here. I feel vindicated knowing how Cal is exiting, because it's exactly how I predicted all those years ago. 

The only thing....Tubby's teams were all about defense first, so I don't know how he would do at UK in the modern NCAA game.

Honestly, the cynical, tired-of-Mitch's-bullshit side of me wouldn't be surprised if Mitch told him to hold out before agreeing and they can get more money for him. Because while a title should be enough, a lot of boosters would rightfully expect to get away with paying Drew far less than they'd be willing to offer a Donovan or Hurley.

The only real problem on our side is that a lot of recruit and transfer options are going to go away the longer this takes. Many would be fine with that if it ends with a stellar coach, but if it drags on and leads to some third-tier choice, heads will roll.

2422,"> How does anybody willingly turn down a job at one of the Big 3 of UNC, Kentucky or Kansas

It's not as bad at UNC or Kansas, but the reality is most of the kinds of coaches you're talking about don't need the brand to succeed, most of the places they're already coaching are more than willing and perfectly able to pay just as much money, and (this is where the Kentucky job really stands out) the pressure to succeed at the highest level in a tournament that is basically a crap shoot is immense. Calipari is the second hall of fame coach that won a national championship that Kentucky has run off in 20 years. A guy like Oats can stay at Alabama, still get his bag, and they will name stadiums after him for a career that would currently be unacceptable at Kentucky.  

Even when Calipari went to Kentucky, Memphis offered him more money than he got there to stay. But Calipari was someone who was viewed as dirty coach and was desperate for the legitimacy that coaching a blood blood could give him and Kentucky was finally desperate enough for success that they were willing to hold their nose and hire him, so that was a just the right guy being available at the right time for exactly the right place.",UNC; Kentucky; Kansas; Calipari; Oats;Alabama; Memphis,Team; Team; Team; Coach; Coach; Team; Team

Every now and then he gets really excited after a Big W and will grab the mic and yell and not sound too Christian and the announcers are always taken aback when he does that lol, it‚Äôs like he breaks character from time to time. 

I have zero doubts about his ability to fit in *anywhere* in the country. He‚Äôs extremely intelligent and never puts a foot wrong with what he says or with his public image.

We might as well have gotten the death penalty for how bad our future looked (that all happened my sister‚Äôs freshman year at Baylor, I remember it so well, it was crazy). When he got here we had *maybe* **THREE** players on scholarship after 10 transferred (two of the players who transferred started for final four teams the following season, one was national player of the year), 1 went to prison, and 1 was murdered by the aforementioned prison one. 

Drew‚Äôs first recruiting class contained two 3-stars and a no-star, basically guys no one else wanted. But it included Aaron Bruce - a beautiful Aussie who‚Äôs probably out there right now absolutely killing it at life with a beautiful broad - who broke the B12 freshman scoring record and was a four year starter and probably somewhere in our top 5 all time scorers list. 

The next year he brings in three 4-stars, our first in program history. All three from Texas within a couple hours‚Äô drive of Waco. All three would start for four years. 

Then, in 2006, he brings in Tweety Motherfucking Carter, the all-time leading scorer in American high school basketball, a 5-star rated PG, and McDonalds All-American. 

That was the game-changer. 

And people say we paid Tweety come here. To those who say that, I will tell them that I know that‚Äôs not true cause when Tweety was a freshman at Baylor I was a sophomore at HS in Waco and bought weed from him frequently. He told me on a few occasions that he only sold weed to send money back home since the scholarship only covered school and room & board. And athletes weren‚Äôt allowed to get jobs back then.

Tweety‚Äôs senior year, and my freshman year at Baylor, he lead us to an Elite 8 where we‚Äôd barely lose to eventual national champs Duke. We‚Äôd bring in our first 5-star that cycle and then average almost one per year for the next 15 years.

If you're a mid-major school you get the scraps left over from the P5 and are told to be thankful for it while your best players are picked every year. And with unlimited transfers, you can take a guy the P5 didn't want, show he can ball out, and he immediately goes back up.

There's no continuity, there's no reason to feel excited for the future. It's depressing and it sucks as a fan. If you have an exciting freshman the thought isn't ""wow, in 2 years we could do something special,"" it's ""wow, this is our only chance""",,

If an MVC guy transfers up and gets minutes over an existing P6 guy, then objectively speaking the MVC guy is better. Even if the existing P6 guy transfers down, he's not going to light the world on fire in the MVC if he wasn't good enough to retain his minutes on a P6 team.

3102,"has to. it's the only way he's gonna see minutes, meaningful minutes. With Edey, Loyer is a solid starter due to the need of surrounding Edey with shooters.

the current Fort Wayne players have uhhhhhh not progressed well lol",,
3124,He played because Painter is stubborn.  We had Heide and Colvin getting drastically less minutes for a majority of the season because Painter refused to change.  he's a great leader and a great hustler but he's not making any Bigten team better if he he's coming in as a starter. Purdue fans just love the white guy who hustles his ass off despite not scoring a single point in the month of February... I don't blame Morton but there were hundreds of minutes on the table that could have gone to Heide/Colvin this season that may have elevated Purdue to an even higher level of play. Instead it took a 19 pt game from Heide on Feb 28th before Morton finally took a back seat and had diminished minutes. It seriously took Painter 28 fucking games into Morton's senior year to realize Morton isn't the guy if Purdue actually wants to win a National title.,Painter; Heide; Colvin; Bigten; Purdue; Morton,Coach; Player; Player; Conference; Team; Player

3133,"Part of it is the start time, but I think another part is that men's teams have so much less identity than women's these days.  The women almost always stay 3-5 years at one school.  Fluid portals + 1 and done mean that the best men's players rarely pause long before going pro, the next tier often shuffles around after a year or 2, and the guys that stay 3+ years on one team are often medium-tier players at best, and their teammates are the ones flying in and out of the jerseys.

Some would miss the game entirely, and many would just get home for the final few minutes. Even an 8 Easterm tip is going to result in lots of people missing the first half. They could potentially tially move the tip to something like 9 flat rather than 9:20, but when you go earlier than that you're starting to actually fuck over those on the West Coast, as opposed to mildly inconveniencing those on the East Coast with later start times.",,

I know it's a different sport but ESPN has been pretty receptive on moving the kickoff of the CFP championship up because of game length and complaints about how late the game went (typically ending after Midnight on the East Coast). Kickoff used to be 8:30 ET - we're now kicking off at 7:45 ET.

The complaints about the tip time have been a thing for a while (and frankly, I think the game should tip at 8:30 or 8:45 ET) but until there's enough complaints from talking head pundits about how late the tip is, it's probably not changing.",,
3365,the men have no gripping stories and a bad gametime.,,
3366,Are you more likely to stay up late or leave work early to watch a national championship game your team isn‚Äôt in?,,
3367,"Try thinking about the West Coast perspective for a second. Many people on the West Coast have hour plus commutes. So if they leave work at 5, many are getting home at like 6-6:30. If a major sports game started at, say, 7 Eastern, that would be 4 Pacific. Meaning the game would be mostly over by the time many on the West Coast get home.

So yeah, late start times might mildly inconvenience the East Coast. But an early start time would *completely* fuck over the West Coast. 

Most interested parties on the East Coast will choose to stay up a little later to watch a game. But how many on the West Coast will actively take off time from work to catch a game? A lot less. The networks have decided, then, that an earlier start time would cost them more West Coast viewers than it would gain them East Coast viewers, which is why they don't do it.",,
3368,"The women's Final Four was way more interesting. I straight up skipped the semifinals for the men and don't feel like I missed anything. UConn felt inevitable and Purdue is boring to watch.

3371,"Yeah the way it worked out was perfect for max drama.  First off had 2 teams go to back to back final 4s, something I don't think has happened in the mens tournament since 2015.  They had a championship rematch in the Elite 8, Iowa faced off vs the most dominant program in the sport in the final 4 and then a Final 4 rematch in the championship.  That's the dream scenario basically (other than flipping the UConn and LSU matchups).

Think of that 2014-2015 tournament.  2014 Wisconsin beat Arizona by 1 in overtime but then get upset by Kentucky in the Final 4 when Kentucky was the 8 seed.  Then the next year once again Wisconsin beat Arizona in the Elite 8 and then this year they get revenge and beat the undefeated Kentucky team.  Now throw in there a player that's as nationally relevant as Clark and you'd have crazy ratings.

Say what you want about the WNBA not allowing players to go pro till they stay 4 years (or maybe 3 I'm not sure) but it allows for more of these recognizable faces to rematch and go back for revenge in the tournament.  It's different when it's 2 schools playing each other back to back years when most of the good players are gone from last year than when both teams kept basically the same starting 5 or at least the stars.",Iowa; UConn; LSU; Kentucky;Wisconsin; Arizona; Clark,Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Player

Very clear that the WBB tournament was, at minimum, of equal interest after the first weekend.

The move of making the WBB Final Four/Champ from Sunday/Tuesday to Friday/Sunday was also a smart change.

There‚Äôs a lot of things the Men‚Äôs game could take from the Women‚Äôs to make their product more entertaining. Switch to quarters and decrease coach timeouts. Put players more front and center (halftime interviews with players). Allow advancement of the ball with timeouts. Unfortunately, the rules committee is made up of mostly coaches who don‚Äôt want to change.

The Women‚Äôs Tournament also has the advantage of having stars having to play 3 years before being WNBA-eligible. And, sadly, that WNBA salaries pale in comparison to what a major star could get in NIL (that part is not sad, the WNBA salary is).

Most interested parties on the East Coast will choose to stay up a little later to watch a game. But how many on the West Coast will actively take off time from work to catch a game? A lot less. The networks have decided, then, that an earlier start time would cost them more West Coast viewers than it would gain them East Coast viewers, which is why they don't do it.

So yeah, late start times might mildly inconvenience you. But an early start time would *completely* fuck over the West Coast. 

Most interested parties on the East Coast will choose to stay up a little later to watch a game. But how many on the West Coast will actively take off time from work to catch a game? A lot less.

The reason they like Sunday and Monday night is because everyone is at home streaming or watching tv anyways, so they get additional eyeballs/screens because the average person has nothing better to do but watch the game.

If that is true then the B12 entered into negotiations with the Big East, knowing that they couldn't reach a deal because Fox didn't want to. 

  
So either the Big East negotiated with both conferences and both conferences decided that they didn't want to play the Big East on their own, or Fox pressured them and at least the B12 negotiated with the Big East knowing they couldn't accept any offers. 



I guess there is a third option where the B1G backed out for their own reasons, and then Fox seized on this and pressured the B12 to back out in order to set up a B12 B1G battle but again there doesn't seem to be a plausible scenario where both the B12 and B1G were forced/pressured by Fox and neither negotiated in bad faith, knowing they couldn't accept a deal.",Big East; B1G; B12,Conference; Conference; Conference

4059,"Why do people not understand the term blue blood? Why do they think it‚Äôs an insult when told the fact that UConn is not a blue blood? They are a new blood. Blue blood is not a term for teams with lots of championships. It‚Äôs not a term for programs that are very good.

It comes from a term referring to aristocrats with a long history of noble blood. Pampered rich people who had pale skin from never having to work outside, therefore making it easy to see their blue veins. Royal families are super snotty and clique; they don‚Äôt allow someone to join just because their family became rich 25 years ago. You need a long history for that.

You can‚Äôt be a blue blood because you win a bunch recently. In 30 years, yes they would be one. They can‚Äôt become one fast. UConn wouldn‚Äôt be a blue blood even if they won the title the next five years.

Was Adolph Rupp racist? Sure, at least a little. But the dude was born in 1901 in the middle of bumfuck Kansas. Of course he was a little racist. It was the environment he was raised in. But if you look at his full record it's not nearly as bad as your vilification would indicate.  Recruiting black players into the SEC at the time was not a straightforward task. Bringing them on the road to places like Mississippi would be actively dangerous. Even so, he had unsuccessfully recruited several black players for years before the first one signed on. He can't exactly be held fully at fault for people choosing to not sign up. And when the south wasn't an issue, he actually coached a black player in *1929* in Illinois, and was instrumental in getting the first black player on team USA in 1948. He even asked the university president to leave the SEC so he could recruit black players.

While now the debate has degraded to name calling, racial tension was a part of that rivalry for many until it wasn't.

The reality for GU basketball is it has lost most of its national relevance.  To a large degree it has also become an afterthought among sports fans in the DC area.

Some people at GU may think they have little to gain by playing GW, but the GU program has fallen so far they also have little more to lose.

If Georgetown wants to generate more local/regional interest in its program, playing one of its two most logical regional rivals (Maryland is the other) and one that has some strong similarities as an academic institution and is located 1 1/2 miles away would definitely help do that.  Just play the game at Capital One Arena but treat the game as a neutral site game and split the tickets 50/50.  I suspect many, many people on both sides as well as many college basketball fans in the DC area will come out of the woodwork to attend.

4959,">maybe 8X the amount of final fours **and elite 8‚Äôs**

I didn't say 8x the amount of final fours, there's a concatenate there bud. My point was Cal appeared far more often than Drew, hence the hyperbole.

Calipari: 17 years, two separate teams (3 & 4 years each to build up)

* Elite 8's: 94, 95, 05, 06, 07
* Final Fours: 95, 07

Scott Drew: 20 years, one school (4 years before first round of 64)

* Elite 8: 09, 11, 20
* Final four: 20

So in 11 years Cal had 6 Elite 8's, and two final fours, and a runner up to Drew in 16 having 3 Elite 8's, one final four, and a title. And if you go by Sweet 16's it's;

* Calipari: 91, 94, 95, 05, 06, 07, 09 or 7/11 (63%) of seasons (41% unadjusted)
* Drew: 09, 11, 13, 16 20, or 5/16 (31%) of seasons (25% unadjusted)

So how, Mr. Alter, is that ""still better than Cal""...?

Cal's resume was nuts and without the gap of 1996-2000 he would have even more with either team playing like they were.

On the day of the National Title game, the sports world was focused on UK and Cal. On the day after the most dominant tourney run of the modern era, the main story is ""Who does UK get? Can they get Hurley""?

Hurley just last week complained about how UConn doesn't get the same exposure as UK, Duke, UNC, Kansas and Gonzaga.

UConn is not a top job. It's a good job, but it does not have the money, resources or brand that UK has.

>Again, money isn‚Äôt everything, especially when Hurley‚Äôs gonna get a bump from us anyways. Some people have no interest in living in Kentucky or dealing with Kentucky fans just as other people would have to live in Connecticut or deal with Connecticut fans.

His agent cares because it's more money for the agent and Hurley's best interest to listen. Leverage matters.

And if it's plausible a coach might job hop from a school to a true blue blood, then that school is not a blue blood.

I don‚Äôt think he will go to Kentucky. He just won back to back and wants to continue on that front. Hurley believes UConn is the best job in the country. Most UK fans think the Kentucky job is the best. 

Personally, I believe there is different strokes for different folks. Hurley is not going to go to UK, start over in a sense, and deal with a fan base that is rabid.

As for your Big East remarks. It's not a superior conference. If it was, UConn wouldn't be running a $70M deficit and lagging significantly in resources.

UK is going to offer more money than what Kirby Smart makes at Georgia. UConn is going to have to come up quite a bit.

You may not agree with any of this, but that doesnt matter, because Hurley does.

-Big East basketball >>>>> all other college basketball

-Storrs South aka Madison Square Garden is the best place for a conference tourney possible

-The northeast (specifically Jersey where he and his wife are both from) is the best place in the US to live. Both of their families are here, and family is everything to him

-He doesn't want players who are interested in getting a bag. He wants players who want to play basketball and win rings. He's talked about part of why he loves Castle so much was he's the anti-five star recruit and how his recruitment was never once about the bag he'd get

-His players are his children, and he doesn't want his children to go to a school ranked 159th in the country

-The Dairy Barn has the best ice cream in the world (ok, this one is a joke and I don't even believe it, but if you don't know what the Dairy Barn even is, stop acting like you have anywhere close to the knowledge I have on UConn that I do)

-Kentucky fans are worse than UConn fans, and his wife thinks they're as bad as Providence fans. Name me a time UConn fans ran off a Hall of Fame coach with a lifetime contract

Again, doesn't matter if you buy into any of this. Hurley does. But feel free to keep thinking about how Hurley, Oats, Donovan, Wright all spurned your ""top job in basketball.""

In the original sense, a blue blooded family is such not because of what they currently have but what they historically had (namely land). It's not unusual in the UK to find someone in the peerage with a title and little else, but those people are still ""blue bloods"". To me, the history of basketball is still too short for 25 years to establish that kind of history.

I think the big problem here is that everyone has a different definition, and for a lot of people it's ""the top tier of the sport"". In my opinion, blue bloods are the teams that are important to the entire history of basketball, not just the recent history.

In short I think blue blood doesn't equal good team. There are blue bloods who have not been good in a while (sorry Indiana) and there are, to extend the metaphor, ""nouveaux riche"" teams (Duke, UConn).",Indiana; Duke; UConn,Team; Team; Team

Since 2006 UConn has missed the national tournament 8 times and got eliminated in the first round in 4 more. For UNC, Duke, Kentucky or KU missing the tournament is a fluke and humiliation for the program. For UConn its routine, even during its supposed golden era.

5460,"The unusual thing about UConn is that they don‚Äôt fit the archetype in any sense except for national championships (I wouldn‚Äôt even say overall tournament success, for reasons I‚Äôll say below)

To be clear, after last night, UConn deserves to be called a blue blood at this point. But every other blue blood, and even stretching out to the top *ten* consistently good teams, those teams maintain 70%+ win rates almost every year in the regular season, make the tournament virtually every year, and get a championship every 15-30 years or so, maybe 7-15 years for blue bloods. This sort of pattern is followed by almost every consistently good team.

Except UConn. UConn has missed the tournament *entirely* SEVEN times in the last 25 years, and won SIX championships during that time. That‚Äôs twice as much as anyone else over the same period. They are now tied for 3rd overall in number of championship victories, but they‚Äôve appeared  in *less than half* as many title games as any other blue blood, on average. Most blue bloods maintain roughly a 50/50 win rate in title games, but UConn is undefeated. All of their wins came within the last 25 years.

Here are the win percentages of the 4 major blue bloods and UConn in the last 25 years. Title appearances column is all time to emphasize the win rate discrepancy.

| School  | Ovr W% | Tourn. % | All Title App. | Title Wins Since ‚Äô99 |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Kansas  | 82.8%  | 100%     | 10             | 2              |
| Duke    | 78.3%  | 100%     | 11             | 3              |
| UNC     | 72.9%  | 91.67%   | 11             | 3              |
| Kentucky| 75.4%  | 87.5%    | 12             | 1              |
| UConn   | 69.0%  | 70.83%   | 6              | 6             |

This table illustrates to me why UConn doesn‚Äôt fit the blue blood archetype in literally any way except for
Number of titles won‚Ä¶ but that happens to be the most important stat, especially in the modern interpretation. They‚Äôre confidently the worst in every stat by a noticeable margin of these teams, and yet they‚Äôve won twice as many titles as anyone in all of college over that time. This is why they don‚Äôt feel like a blue blood, even though they look like one when you only look at titles.

5480,"UCLA is as debatable as Indiana at this point.  Since the 70's, they've looked more like a run of the mill good power conference program than any kind of elite program.  Endlessly in and out of Top 25, occasional peaks and valleys, exactly one title in almost 50 years...

They're basically just Florida or Michigan at this point.",UCLA; Indiana; Florida; Michigan,Team; Team; Team; Team
5481,"But UConn has not had 25 years of sustained excellence. Since 2007 they missed the national tournament 8 times and got eliminated in the first round 4 more times. I agree that *sustained* excellence is what gets you blue blood status, but UConn has not had that.",UConn,Team
5482,We understand the hate.  Kansas fans are particularly good at displaying it as they scramble to justify their blue-bloodedness while UConn passes them by as the best program of the last 30 years.,Kansas; UConn,Team; Team
5483,"Respectfully, I disagree. Acknowledging I am in the vast minority of people, I do not recognize Duke as a blue-blood just yet for the same reason people think UCLA and Indiana are no longer blue bloods (also a proposition with which I disagree; joining the club comes with a lifetime membership, which is part of the reason it needs to be a high bar to get in). That reason is: recency bias. People say ""UCLA and IU are out because they haven't done anything recently."" Another way of saying that is ""UCLA hasn't proven that its history is bigger than the Wooden years, and IU hasn't proven that its history is bigger than the Knight years."" Thus, for similar reasons, I believe Duke has yet to prove its stamp on college hoops history is more than the Krzyzewski years. And because I believe blue-blood status relates back with no expiration, it's a higher bar to get in in the first place. Hence, Duke? Not yet in the club for me.

But what keeps UConn out is not the same thing that keeps Duke out. Banners aren't enough. If they were, then we would be talking about programs like Oklahoma State, Florida, Michigan State and Villanova having claims to blue blood status, too. So we look at what distinguishes the undisputed blue bloods (KU/UNC/UK/UCLA) from the programs with multiple title banners but we all agree don't *really* pass the sniff test to be called blue bloods, like the Floridas and Michigan States. The answer to that question is more subjective, but seems to be a similarly-high bar: what is your program's contribution *to* the game. Not what is your program's achievement *within* the game, but how did your program change the game itself, or how does your program transcend title banners or W-L record? 

And that's what keeps UConn out. It can't claim winningest program of all time. It can't claim most titles. It can't claim a uniquely historical run, such as an undefeated season or back-to-back titles. It can't claim Final Four appearances in every decade. It can't claim a deep-rooted coaching tree. It can't claim some kind of historical impact on the game itself, like rule changes. For Duke, they get to claim the GOAT - Coach K's the winningest *coach* of all time, and while he didn't roll off a Wooden-esque five-in-a-row, he made his bones in the 64-team and 68-team eras without the benefit of geographical regionals. Even if you don't acknowledge K as *better* than Wooden, you have to acknowledge him as being the only coach who is Wooden's equal when accounting for differences in eras.

Now, just because I can't come up with UConn's X-factor doesn't mean there isn't one. Maybe it just means I don't know what it is. But the fact that fans of undisputed blue-bloods tend to know other blue-bloods' histories suggests UConn doesn't have one.",Duke; UCLA; Indiana; IU; Wooden; Knight; Krzyzewski; Oklahoma State; Florida; Michigan State; Villanova; UConn; KU; UNC; UK; UCLA; Coach K; K,Team; Team; Team; Team; Coach; Coach; Coach; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Coach; Coach

People put WAY too much meaning into the term Blue Blood. Maybe because it sounds cooler than ""Elite Program."" The term Blue Blood refers to aristocratic families that have been wealthy & powerful for many generations. Think of the Kennedys, Rockefellers or Vanderbilts. 

The term is just more relevant for CFB than CBB since it basically just means ""programs that have (mostly) been elite since the earliest days of the sport like Michigan & Alabama."" If that applied equally to CBB we'd only have 3 ""real"" blue bloods: UNC, Kansas, & Indiana. But if given the opportunity would UConn trade their history with Kansas or Indiana? I doubt it.

Even a bad year for Kansas or North Carolina or Duke is still typically a tournament year. Or you can look at the number of sweet 16s and elite 8s. 

Blue blood to me says there is something inherent about the program that generates consistent, long-term success. The tournament is so random it's honestly kind of weird how UConn has been able to go on these runs without many sweet 16s or elite 8s.

A few years ago we were linked to Matt Campbell, but Campbell declined, and we got DeBoer however we're not a Blue Blood in Football. When Saban retired everyone was linked to the job and no one was safe.

However, the way Dan Hurley laughed not once, but twice at the notion of Kentucky, then flat out shook his head and said No on the Pat Mcafee Show before Pat could finish his question - That cemented it for me. UConn is a blue blood. There's no other way around it. Kentucky had absolutely no shot and it was almost laughable to think they actually believed they had a shot at Hurley. 

After seeing Hurley laugh at UK twice, UConn is unequivocally a Blue Blood and a tier above Kentucky in the perception of many fans eyes at this very moment.

Duke had a winning percentage of .597 at that time for its first 85 years of being a program and no Championships. Prior to 1990 they had only made the finals 3 times, been in 7 final fours and been in 9 elite eights.

Meanwhile UConn currently has a winning percentage of .644; they have 6 Championships, 7 final fours and 13 elite eights.

So UConn has +.047 record against ""Blue Blood Duke"", +6 Championships on ""Blue Blood Duke"", even on final fours and +4 elite eights against Duke of 1990. Hell they have double the championship appearances of Duke by that point in their history.

I didn't say Duke was a blue blood in 1990. I said they already had plenty of accolades before K. 

Anyway, you can't strictly look at cumulative numbers now vs. 1990 when 35 years more of potential accomplishments have accumulated for every program out there. UConn is being compared against what other programs have accomplished up to 2024, there is no set cumulative threshold for a blue blood worthy number of championships. In 200 years from now, if college hoops persist, 6 championships will not be enough for anybody. 

But let's look at 1992 after 2 Duke championships. Let's take the 3 universally accepted blue bloods, UCLA who is nearly universally accepted, and for comparison's sake let's include Louisville who is outside the blue blood convo but in the next tier, and has had fairly consistent success across eras even into the 21st century (i.e., not concentrated into the past or present to skew anything). Also, I only list all time rank for the AP stat as that's the only one that was readily available to me.

Anyways, we were then independents and after the NCAA ruled against the ECAC tournaments for Eastern independents to get automatic berths to the NCAAs, we ended up in the Big East because of our market and then nearly-rebuilt Hartford Civic Center.

As for BC, they hired Gary Williams over Northeastern‚Äôs Boston-bred coach, one Jim Calhoun. To this day, he abhors them and when Williams went to Ohio State, Calhoun took the UConn job over the BC one.

As for realignment, the old Big East had a similar situation with Penn State. We rejected them when they wanted to join (this was almost entirely due to horrible timing). Then, they chose the B1G instead of us.

However, lets say in the next 20 years UConn wins another 6 Championships, do they get to be a Blue Blood then, since no one will have won as many as them?

Is it possible to *become* a Blue Blood or is it really, ""should have been good in the 60's"" that determines that.

Another good question is, how shitty does Indiana have to be to no longer be a Blue Blood, or is that not possible as well?",UConn; Indiana,Team; Team

And for the most part, it‚Äôs not close. The gap between #5 and #6 in FF appearances, is 5- that‚Äôs just two appearances shy from matching UConn‚Äôs entire historical output.

That‚Äôs just about the same gap as #6 (1993 wins total) and #50 (Mizzou, 1691).

It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúnew barrier to entry‚Äù imo, it‚Äôs that Blue Blood is synonymous with sustained long-term success.

I don't think that comes up to the same level, but again, if other people think it should we can have that debate.

I don't think the social media manager at KU Athletics is the arbiter of which programs are or are not blue-bloods.

I think we have to be careful when we use phrases like ""*historically* winning,"" because the history of college hoops goes back a lot further than 1999 and, even with the last 25 years, UConn only ranks #23 on the all-time wins list. UConn has had a lot of good six-game streaks, obviously. But it's also missed the tourney completely almost 1/3 of the time in that same span (8 no-shows in last 25 years).

As for Duke's claim, I don't disagree. For me personally, I don't put Duke among the blue bloods for exactly the reason you suggest. However, I acknowledge that my paradigm is very much a minority opinion, so I include what arguably makes Duke a blue-blood already. And simply stated - Duke's in a better position than UConn. The *only* thing Duke has to do to solidify itself as a blue-blood, in my opinion, is win one more natty to show it's a championship program even without Coach K. But UConn demonstrates *why* titles aren't the only factor to be considered in granting admission to the club. In 2011, UConn proved that the season doesn't matter as long as you get hot for nine games in March. Their *only* shot that year was an AQ bid, and they ran it to a title. And the Kevin Ollie year? Does anybody view that run as anything other than fluky with Ollie babysitting a bunch of Calhoun's recruits? That doesn't take away from the achievement. The rings were earned fair and square. But it goes to show that there's more to it than having a few great six-game runs across the entire sport since the first intercollegiate hoops game in 1895.",KU; UConn; Coach K; Duke; Kevin Ollie; Calhoun,Team; Team; Coach; Team; Coach; Coach

Also, comparisons are important because there are definitely minimums required for anything. The first college to play a varsity basketball game was either Geneva College or Vanderbilt. Geneva College is currently in the D3 Presidents‚Äô Athletic Conference composed of tiny private liberal arts colleges in Western Pennsylvania, while Vanderbilt is the doormat of the SEC. Yet surely they (along with Springfield College, where Dr. James Naismith invented basketball) would have been they would have been the best (and worst) basketball programs in 1893 as they were the only ones, right?

Five of the blue bloods have unique claims:

Kansas‚Äô worst coach was Dr. James Naismith himself. Among their alumni are Wilt Chamberlain, Dean Smith, and Adolph Rupp.

Kentucky was the first Southern (well, border state at least) school to win an NCAA tournament and also has the most wins.

UNC has had success (including titles) under multiple coaches over a long period of time. They actually beat Wilt in a 57-54 3OT National Championship game in 1957. Four corners offense!

UCLA has the most titles and the two best candidates for the college MBB GOAT: Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton. Also, John Wooden wasn‚Äôt a slouch either

Indiana has the last undefeated season and a long-established history (first title in 1940). They also have history under multiple coaches.

Which leaves us with Duke: known as a perennial choker until 1991, all success under one coach, only five titles, and they seem to have forced their way into the blue blood fraternity instead of asking for acceptance.

I feel like Duke is the closest comparable to UConn.

Schools will start cutting sports and/or having the students/general fund subsidize the AD even more than they already are.

And the whole ""players can't transfer to the Big 2"" is unlikely to even win in the courts. Courts hate non-compete clauses and that's what it is.  Even moreso when you're asking high schoolers to sign non-competes.

And spinning off from the Big 2 won't decrease costs.  You'll still be competing for coaches, you'll still be in a facilities arms race with each other (and the Big 2), you'll stilll have Title IX.  But you'll have gutted all revenue making streams.

By the time I started watching CBB I was probably 11-12 and he had just started at Memphis. By the time I was in HS he had built Memphis into a powerhouse similar to how people view Gonzaga now, but he was recruiting like a blue-blood (which Gonzaga does now, but didn‚Äôt do until recently). He *owned* the first decade of the 1-and-done era. Derrick Rose was the first one. #1 recruit in the country, could‚Äôve gone #1 in the draft out of HS but they changed the rule so he went to Memphis with Cal and almost led them to a title 

Then my senior year of HS there are rumors of Drew to UK, meanwhile Cal had probably the best recruiting class of all time his last class at Memphis, but then took them to Kentucky with him - it was insane. 

That was my senior year of HS so I was getting so pumped about college basketball since I was going to Baylor and Baylor had just made the tournament for the first time in decades and people finally realized Drew was a Messiah. 

But Calipari, Wall, and Boogie going to UK was like LeBron/Wade/Bosh going to Miami. I‚Äôll never forget that. Baylor were in Wall‚Äôs top 3 so I followed that cycle super closely.

And it must‚Äôve been Memphis I was thinking of that was after him at that time, not UK. I remember that article. It gave him a bad rep for a few years, which was very undeserved. It brought up the old story about him negatively recruiting against fellow B12 coaches from his first couple of years (he sent recruits a flyer saying he was the only coach in the B12 who had recruited a McDonalds All American which included pictures of Bob Knight and Bill Self X‚Äôd out; to be fair, it was true at the time; Tweety Carter baby!). Then everyone thought he was paying players to come here after we got our first ever 5-star (Perry fucking Jones III) so there was some negativity around him again from opposing fans. 

But none of it was ever warranted. He rubbed some old heads wrong when he was in his low 30‚Äôs (Bob Knight approached him at media days - or the conference tournament, I forget - and grabbed him by the collar and chewed him out about it; he‚Äôs probably the one who fed that info to the Memphis journalist), that happens in the workplace.

Meanwhile, Arkansas has been left with literally zero scholarship players since Muss left. Not. A. Single. One!  However, with Coach Cal's recruiting prowess, the Hogs should be loaded up with talent in no time flat. Imagine how long it would take to rebuild our team under practically anybody else. We faced potentially years and years of rebuilding. With no telling whom as our coach. (Thank goodness we dodged hiring Chris ""Austin Strangler"" Beard. Yes, yes, I meant *alleged* strangler!)

And let's just say Arkansas gets about five good years with Coach Cal, maybe one or two of which could be great, or dare I say it, perhaps even one spectacular tournament run. Most of our fans would be satisfied with that. And then we'll just bring in another great coach. The floor for our coach's salary and NIL has been significantly raised to bring in superstar talent.

Harder to coach, some of what you do is not necessarily to win, but develop for the next level, and the teams with seniors are just smarter, better basketball players at that level.

well, he will have to. theres not another edey on this roster.  even if will berg steps in to that spot (he wont.  TKR will very likely start, but still...), this game is more rounded than edey.  it was in garbage time, but berg hit a 8 foot turnaround fadeaway a few weeks ago, and supposedly has a good shot

could be off on this, but i think having edey kind of limited painters realistic options to a point.  you dont have a player that dominant, that efficient, and that game-breaking and not run your offense through him every single game.  painter has run very good action for guards before when the guards were purdues game changers (edwards/cline year, for example), but that certainly wasnt the case this year.

purdue has also recruited better athletes recently, so just by that, the team should look pretty different on offense next year, hopefully more free flowing and better spacing without edey in the game to control the offense.  even starting TKR would require a significant transition on offense.

going to be a rough few months i think with so many starting minutes up for grabs, but expect purdue to be back in the tournament next year, maybe as a 5 or 6 seed.",Painter; TKR; edey; berg; painter; purdue; edwards; cline,Coach; Player; Player; Player; Coach; Team; Player; Player

Not try to get any sort of guard moving in the direction of the basket to make Clingan at least make a decision on who to stop? Get a switch on Renn and then bring Edey out to set a back screen off ball and get Renn down in the post on Newton or Spencer or Castle?

Even if he had gone 32/54, That's all twos and still only 64 points, But even if you account for say, 8 free throws, That's still 72 points and three points lower than what Uconn scored. 

The problem with this hypothetical is there's no way he would shoot that well. 

Too many of the attempts would be terrible looks and also, the increased volume of possessions where he's required to dig deep to get into good position equals more fatigue. 

The only chance Purdue had was getting clingan into foul trouble really early, imo.",Uconn; Purdue; clingan,Team; Team; Player
7884,"Yeah, sticking with the plan eventually led to all the dominos falling.  I got a little worried when we started getting into foul trouble with almost 10 min left, but Edey was tired and the rest of the team startes to panic a little so we were able to maintain.

One part of the plan that gets overlooked a little is that by playing 1v1 with Clingan, it helped Uconn to out rebound Purdue.  Edey outplayed Clingan offensively, but Clingan boxed him out well enough by himself to allow our bigger guards to get rebounds.",Edey; Clingan; Uconn; Purdue,Player; Player; Team; Team

Purdue would run towards Karaban, and he would throw it to an open guy at half court. And Purdue literally never did anything else.

I know that Purdue probably didn‚Äôt press teams very often this year. I know that UConn has very talented guards. But like wtf? Do they literally only have one press play in the playbook?

7906,"He talked about it in the post game press conference. Their guards were excellent defenders. They had length and athleticism on us. They were also playing extremely tight to prevent us from taking shots. We could barely get open in the first half. They were handling our screens and sets. The few times we got open looks for half a second, we didn't pull the trigger instantly.

Then we had to play to limit their transition offense, so we didn't want to jack up bad 3s. Bad 3s are long rebounds that UConn uses to go on a 30-0 run. This game featured a bunch of 5-2 trading because we couldn't buy a rebound due to the athletic guard discrepancy plus Clingan being such a hard matchup for Edey. 

The game plan was that we match up worse at guard than them, so we have to open the game with Edey's scoring. He scores. We get a stop. We get a rebound. He scores. They double him because he'll just keep scoring and extending or maintaining the lead. He kicks out for 3. 

The problem is, we'd get the stops and not the rebounds. So we couldn't build a lead to force the double. And that's a credit to them being totally locked in. And then, they run their long sets with off ball movement, and they're bigger and faster than we are, so we are getting gassed trying to run around for 30 seconds. Then they get it off the offensive glass and it's another 20. Then we have to go up the court with Castle on Smith just pressuring him for 40 minutes.

At this point all you can do is add maybe one or two new sets.  You don‚Äôt want to be running new things against a defense like UConns who will pick apart any mistake.   

Pushing the pace isn‚Äôt something that would have been in Purdues favor.  Similar to how the press wasn‚Äôt. They would have been mauled if they tried to run with UConn.  I would have enjoyed that immensely.

It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm annoyed with the Caitlin Clark discourse and the GOAT talk with her. First of all, requiring titles for GOATS when recruiting, transfer portals, and only able to play 4 years, etc. are a thing makes little sense to me.

And GOAT or not, she took a team full of future Dentists, Optometrists, Occupational Therapists, Cancer Research scientists, Nurses, etc. to the National Championship game twice against multiple teams throughout the tournament laden with future WNBA players.

And by the way, I didn‚Äôt pull those professions out of thin air either. That is in fact professions that her actual teammates are going into now or will when they graduate.

I don‚Äôt care about the GOAT debate in any sport, but saying a player choked or must be trash because they didn‚Äôt win is really dumb.

Every time they DID adjust their press, UConn would read and adjust their break to fill in behind the spy, then they wouldn‚Äôt try to force a dribble and just throw right to it. They were basically forcing Purdue into the same situation no matter what adjustments were made, and that‚Äôs the frustrating and beautiful part of it.",UConn; Purdue,Team; Team
7986,"Yeah. Same press, same press break, 5 times in a row. Not sure it super mattered because UConn didn‚Äôt want to take a shot early in the clock anyway, so giving away the transition opportunity didn‚Äôt change anything. But still, weird to see them stay in it when it‚Äôs such a clearly intentional choice to press and it was so clearly not affecting UConn at all.",UConn,Team
7987,Having 3-4 point guards on the court at any given time made this team essentially impossible to press.,,
7988,"The size advantage took out the press too. Purdue executed the press pretty well, but the UConn guards could just throw over the top of the double team. It was also 5 on 4 since Edey isn't mobile enough to do anything on the backside. One pass out of the double then a safe 60 foot pass into the front court knowing Edey will never get there.",Purdue; UConn; Edey,Team; Team; Player

7990,Is it crazy to think that NC State would have done better against UConn than we did against Purdue? DJ Burns did a great job guarding Flip and our team is less reliant on one person performing well than Purdues is.

7991,"Basically did that at the beginning of the game until he gassed himself. I kind of agree though, that was the only position on the floor we had an advantage. I don't really think there was a way for us to win unless Edey got Clingan in foul trouble.

Defensively, UConn was on another level. Just perfect execution of each defensive game plan for the entire tournament. The only guy who really had a game against them was Sears. I'm not counting Edey because the game plan was never to try to stop him in the first place.",UConn; Sears; Edey,Team; Player; Player

Other teams doubled Edey because they had to. Clingan‚Äôs defense was the definition of making Edey work for it, and over 40 minutes that sustained effort wore him out.

Late in the first half, and about halfway through the second, when UConn finally managed to put together a couple stops and build a lead you can see Edey posting farther out from the basket and leaving those hooks short, and relying more on his right hand.

36% FG in the tourney 36% from 3. that's actually well below average.

Allow me to expand. In conference he was 90/210 FGM/FGA for 42%. Pretty mid.  Only thing he has going for him is assists and like I said, not that hard to dump it to Edey

EDIT: BRING THE DOWNVOTES BABY lol aww purdue lost so we have to coddle them. Idk who tf would say a guy averaging 12 points on 42% is anything but average, even more so when the defense gives up a lot of wide open shots due to Edey but keep them coming.

EDIT 2: Cuz I LOVE these casual Reddit fans and these annoying Purdue fans. Just watched the highlights to get an accurate count. Smith guarded Newton, who absolutely destroyed him, so bad they switched Heidi on him. Here are Smith's assist 1 to Renn on a broken play (when the ball got tipped in the back court and it was a scramble to get it) 1 oop to Edey early, 4 assists to Edey in the post who made a quick hook, 1 late game drop off to Edey in the post being guarded by Karaban when UCONN wasn't trying to play defense and then another late game oop to Edey. 7 of his 8 assists were to Edey with 2 of them coming in the last few minutes when UCONN wasn't even trying. So to recap, 5 of his 8 assists came from dumping the ball to Edey in the post and Edey quickly making a post move, 2 of those came late in the game when UCONN wasn't trying. Real stud out there.  KEEP THE DOWNVOTES COMING! He played absolutely trash just like everyone else on Purdue outside of Edey.

8117,"UConn made a bit of an adjustment, but they were struggling to guard the pick and roll in the first half. They kept letting Smith get downhill to his right hand. That was the four or five minute stretch when Edey kept getting roll passes (including that big dunk over Clingan).

I thought they maybe could have varied that pick and roll a little to try to generate switches. Edey just kind of camped out in the paint posting up. Yeah, he scored fairly efficiently, but he took away all their spacing. I know that's what he does, but he needed to be able to be more dynamic against UConn. 

I know Purdue was undersized at the guards and wings, but only getting up 7 threes IS a coaching issue. They could never get two guys on the ball. They could never generate any swing swing looks.

They don't just post Kalkbrenner all game. He's out screening doing DHOs. Creighton was able to generate great spacing because they don't have a big sitting in the middle clogging the lane.

That's why the NBA doesn't play that way anymore. That big guy can score all the points he wants on seemingly good efficiency. But an Edey post up isn't as efficient as a cut to the basket that generates a dunk or a layup. It's also only moderately more efficient than the average Purdue three pointer.

Against Clingan, he was catching the ball further away, and while he was still making use of that strength and size, Clingan wasn't being moved.  So he'd catch the ball 8-10 feet out, the dunk was out of the question, and he couldn't move Clingan more than a foot or so, if at all.  When the game started and he was making hook shots like Jabbar from that far out, I was sure UConn was in big trouble.

I still honestly believe that even though UConn won the game, Edey deserved MOP.  I figured it would have to be something extraordinary.  And I thought he was exactly that. 

I went in thinking, ""Edey's great. But has he played a guy with the skill and size of Clingan in his career?""  And while I still think up until last night, he hadn't, it largely didn't matter.  He had to work harder than I've had to see him work before (and admittedly, I saw maybe one regular season game, the B1G tournament, and the NCAA, so small sample size).  But he did it.

I think a team that had practiced and actually implemented more diverse offensive sets would have been able to try different things, to get Edey some rest or generate threes a different way.

UConn made an adjustment, and they got away from it. Or maybe Johnson entering the game changed things. Edey got some good looks off the roll in the first half, including that dunk over Clingan. Then Johnson came in, and they went straight to iso post ups, which wasn't a bad idea really. Johnson picked up two quick fouls and went to the bench. Clingan came back in, and they didn't really go back to the pick and roll as much.

UConn was pretty clearly the better team, but I just think that modern offenses need to be able to generate at least 20 three point attempts per game.

Even just a few could have helped, even if it was just help calm them down and lock them back in defensively.

Painter had made a comment during halftime too about how Purdue's guards were going to have to pump fake and dribble slide to help get cleaner looks. Gillis sort of did that and got stuffed.

17499,"The B1G gets lots of 1 seeds but I think it has been pretty rare for a B1G team to secure the overall 1 seed over the last 20 years.    
    
I think it boils down to talent. The B1G recruits and develops well in aggregate but no one team has pooled and retained as much high level talent as some of the teams that have had multiple 1 overalls in that time(IIRC UK, UNC, Duke). The B1G has most of the largest enrollments and alumni bases in the country so maybe the NIL era can help some of the programs collect more talent idk but I think as long as teams kind of rotate in and out of winning and competing for the league title it will be hard to secure a 1 overall.           
           
UK, UNC, Duke don't really go in and out of contending for their respective league titles they're pretty much always at the top of the race every year and it's odd when they're not. There is no B1G equivalent to that lately. Some program is going to hire a young, dominant coach and they're enjoy that for a decade or two I hope it isn't UM but with the resources these programs have I think you just need the right coach to separate from the pack a bit and maybe build to a program that can get multiple overall 1 seeds over a decade. But I think the difference is no team has dominated the B1G and consistently finished top 3 over all that time which is I think how you develop and keep the UK/UNC/Duke recruiting edge over their peers given sufficient resources.

That‚Äôs why he was so successful playmaking as a freshmen him and lively had good chemistry. On paper him, Flagg and khaman is a better fit for his playmaking strengths. Also I disagree on your take on foster our offense was actually at its best when foster when in the starting 5. He has a very tight handle and the ball is on a string when he has it so he rarely turns it over and he is a very good floor spacer and underrated playmaker o think your severely underrating Caleb foster‚Äôs ability to be a PG that‚Äôs his natural position.

Flagg has yet to play a game in college but I can confidently tell you he has a better handle and shooter than Mitchell. Teams won‚Äôt sag off Flagg as badly as they did mark mitchell. 

Isaiah evans as a freshmen  won‚Äôt be the impactful defender mark mithcell is  but he will surprise some folks who aren‚Äôt aware how good his defense is.  Ppl think he is jus an explosive scorer but He is 6‚Äô7 with long arms and a competitive spirit. I‚Äôm more worried about how quickly he will pick up the off ball defensive concepts but he will be a very strong on ball defender 

Not to mention I‚Äôm not very worried at all about when defenses limit transition points because coach J‚Äôs offense simply doesn‚Äôt rely on transition points.

He had a historic slump (remember Jack White‚Äôs?), but is otherwise should force a team to at least have a man near him on the arc as he shoots it above 35%, like I said.

If you look at all 3 NCAA tourney losses for Arizona the starting PG spot is the biggest weakness and in losses they have produced nearly the same game statistically. Boswell couldn't do much beside catch and shoot. He struggles with length and pressure defense and can't get to the rim. When he is on he can be a very good 3 point shooter but that wasn't very often by seasons end. Jaden Bradley is so very clearly the starting PG. He finally breaks the mold of a PG that can't do anything besides catch and shoot. Bradley was awesome in March and his advanced stats were super great off the bench.

Lots of rumors (I don't personally know how valid any of them are) that he was always out partying. 


That being said, he's literally an 18 year-old kid. How many 18 year-olds are always making the right decisions? How many 18 year-olds show consistency at the starting level for a P5 team? How many 18 year-olds can consistently hold their own every game going against 22-23 year-old men? The fact is this: if he gets his priorities straight and puts in the work, we've already seen the potential, he absolutely could be a great player.

So as much as the staff and a lot of us fans love Ballo, it's time for the future big men to take their spots. There's also the thought that Ballo could get big money for a year somewhere, and knowing he's a good dude with a big heart, I wouldn't be surprised if he wants to give something back to his family and community in Mali.


For Boswell, there's no guarantee he would start. It sounds like the staff sees Jaden Bradley as the starting point guard no matter what. Now we could run a 2 point guard system with Boswell as the starter, but there's also talk that Love might be seriously considering coming back, which would push Boswell to the bench.",Ballo,Player
17760,"I don't think it's near as concerning as it might look from the outside. It is just the realities of the transfer portal era. Neither Ballo nor Krivas was going to stick around here to be a back up next year, so Tommy had to choose between one more year of Ballo or potentially three more years of Krivas who was solid as a freshman and appears to have a much higher ceiling than Ballo. Tommy chose Krivas and I agree with that decision. People keep talking about Ballo leaving to ""get a bag"" but I think it just came down to playing time. Ballo isn't going to spend his 6th and final year of college backing up a Sophomore that took his starting spot when he could start at most other schools. And Tommy wasn't going to sacrifice a high ceiling 7'2 center who could be a four year guy to give Ballo one more year.

Boswell's decision comes from a similar place. Jaden Bradley looked better in the second half of the season and clearly Tommy must have indicated he would take the starting PG spot next year. Again, I agree with that decision. But, like Ballo, Boswell isn't going to waste his Junior year in a back up role when he could start at most other places, just like I don't think Bradley would have returned if he wasn't going to be the starter. It is a repeat of what happened last year when Tommy chose Boswell and Kriisa left for West Virginia. Basically, I think we were always going to lose one of Ballo or Krivas and one of Bradley or Boswell. I would have taken Krivas and Bradley and it appears that is the choice Tommy Lloyd made as well. I don't think these departures are any omens of internal upheaval or strife. I think this is just the way things work now.

The first University of Connecticut polo team was organized by Hal Vita in 1969. Polo has been an intercollegiate sport of men at UConn since 1969 and for women since 1976. Since its founding, the team has captured the men‚Äôs National Intercollegiate Polo Championships in 1972, 1973, and 1974 as well as the women‚Äôs National Intercollegiate Polo Championships in 1996, 1997, 1998, 2005, and 2022. The men‚Äôs teams of 1982 and 84 were Reserve National Intercollegiate Polo Champions. The women first came into national prominence in 1995, when they were Reserve National Champions. During the 1997-1998 season, the UConn Women were unbeaten in intercollegiate competition with a perfect 16 and 0 record! UConn‚Äôs men‚Äôs team had a record of nine wins and only two losses that same year, which was the best overall Intercollegiate polo record in the nation for 1997-98 season! In 2001, the program received a major upgrade with the construction of a new indoor arena. At 120 by 220 feet, UConn‚Äôs arena is one of the largest and newest in the country.

[The website of US Soccer](https://www.ussoccer.com/history/timeline) defends the claim, briefly, that the Rutgers v. Princeton game belongs to the history of soccer in the States more than the history of gridiron in the states.

> Soccer was initiated as an organized college sport in the USA in the years following the Civil War. Princeton and Rutgers Universities engaged in the first intercollegiate soccer match Nov. 6, 1876, in New Brunswick, N.J. Rutgers won the match 6-4. **The game was more similar to both rugby and soccer than gridiron football.**

The similarities to both rugby, and the similarities to soccer both make it fair to call a game in the history of intercollegiate soccer and gridiron football, but it's _much_ less of a stretch to consider it a soccer match than to consider it a gridiron match ‚Äî it's just a matter that the rules of what would develop into the ""English game"" were still in flux this early in the history of the football codes.",Princeton; Rutgers,Team; Team
