82,"You can win a conference, but if it's a weak conference, you might still be a lower seed, even a 16 seed. You are guaranteed a spot, but not necessarily a good one. You're almost certainly not one of the top 68 teams in the country if you enter as a 16 seed, but the NCAA still gives you a spot because it makes the tourney more exciting plus a little bit of equal opportunity.

32 conferences all with a guaranteed spot to the winner means there's a gap where a team can be a top 68 or higher team but there's no room left. These are filled by the so-called ""at-large"" bids. Yet the seed should still represent ""how good the team is"" on some level.

Also, although I understand it may be too late at this point, I would like to repeat my suggestion I made leading up to last year's final. For the final only, if your team wins, donate to the food bank of the losing team. If you're a fan of any other team, including the losing team, teams eliminated earlier in the tournament, and teams who did not make it at all, donate to the foodbank of the winning team.

Eric Shero, president of Alliance Bank of Waco and Baylor basketball booster, dips another tortilla chip into his salsa bowl and takes a bite. It's spicier than usual, but with a little bit of a bitter aftertaste. Maybe they overdid the cilantro. ""Man, Scotty, I love this place, but this salsa is working today! I tell you what, you know they don't have salsa like this in Lexington.""

The man sitting opposite Shero in the booth nods, glances up at the TV mounted in the corner over Shero's shoulder. ""Feud's on. You like the Family Feud, Eric?""

Shero blinks uncertainly, then smiles and nods. He likes the Family Feud, right? Steve Harvey? For some reason his thoughts are slipping out of his grasp. ""Sure, I ... I guess so, Scotty. Say, you know, I'm not feeling so good all of a sudden.""  

""Probably just that salsa, Eric. You'll be fine."" The man motions to someone else standing behind the counter. ""Hey look, here's a fan who wants a picture of us together. Smile for the camera, Eric."" Eric's head is swimming. He's unsure now of what exactly is happening, but his instinct, honed from years of corporate glad-handing and big-time athletic boosterism, takes over. He grins and nods. The picture is taken and the photographer slinks out of the restaurant unnoticed. Shero slumps back in the booth. ""Scotty, I ... I think I need to go lay down.""

Scott Drew stands up, leans over Shero, gives him a little pat on the cheek. ""Eric? Eric, listen to me. This is a dream, Eric. You never ate that salsa, we never took that picture, and I was never here. You got that?""

""Never ... here,"" Shero mumbles into his drinks menu.

""That's right. And hey - you helped me out today, big time.  I won't forget it."" And with the photographic evidence of his future alibi secured, Scott Drew leaves the restaurant, headed for an uncertain future. He's surprised by a pang of guilt as he boards his Uber, but quickly dismisses it. ""After all,"" he thinks to himself, ""how many guys would let an opportunity like this slip through their fingers?""

263,"It's hard to remember exactly who rejected us, officially, and when, since we had two searches in a 3-year period.

I remember for certain that Donovan rejected us both times. I think he was the first pick both times.

Once, Jay Wright said no. Izzo listened long enough to get a new contract. Rick Barnes removed his name from consideration (meme - none of us wanted him but he had to get his name in the news). 

We kicked the tires on a lot of names unofficially. Mitch Barnhart really liked Tom Crean and almost no UK fans did. We probably reached out to everyone you'd consider a top 10 coach at the time except K, Roy and Self. The first go-round, Mitch refused to consider Cal (who reportedly would've crawled here). Gillispie got himself the interview and job by beating Pitino in the tourney. Others had said no, I believe, besides the names above. Gillispie was kind of tier 3, I think. There was still a lot of ""Tubby's too nice to have been treated this way"" going around, even though people also no longer considered us elite because of him never getting back to the Final Four, and frankly, getting manhandled by more talented teams. (The Rudy Gay UConn team outclassed us so badly that many of us never forgave Tubby.)

When Gillispie crashed and burned, I don't remember who specifically said no/was being targeted, but Cal was fresh off Derek Rose and then Tyreke Evans, about to bring in the top recruiting class to Memphis, and his stubborn refusal to foul up 3 away from having a ring. (Which the NCAA probably would have been too chicken shit to take away back then. Louisville only lost theirs because of how off the rails they went.)

Even still, Mitch was supposedly forced to hire Cal by boosters. His intro press conference was awkward because one of Mitch's first points was about the compliance protections in the contract (the Rose stuff was big news at the time). 

But outside of people still upset Donovan said no, and those desperate to bring Pitino back, most of us were very happy with Cal. There was a lot of worry over how much smoke he brought from UMass and Memphis, but the NCAA cleared him both times, and once you got to know Cal, he was a good dude. The slimy perception is one that doesn't actually hold up when you get over bias and see how he is in his community.

If not for the probation and taking his recruits, Memphis fans would probably still love Cal.",Donovan; Jay Wright; Izzo; Rick  Barnes; Tom Crean; UK; K; Roy; Self; Cal; Gillespie; Pitino; Rudy Gay; Derek Rose; Tyreke Evans; Louiville,Coach;Coach;Coach; Coach; Coach;Team; Coach;Coach;Coach;Coach;Coach;Coach; Player; Player; Player; Team

Cal's only problem in the transfer portal is guys didn't want to commit to play here when we had possible returnees waiting for draft feedback until the last minute.

Yeah, pretty much. *Six titles*. We can also add in that they had a Final Four and two Elite Eights during that time, if we want to go beyond the six titles, but I'm not sure it's necessary.

>I struggle to call them the top program when they’re a roller coaster with massive ups and downs

I don't. But hey, you can probably make a case for UNC and Duke too. They have 3 titles in that time frame, and have likely been more consistent beyond that.

756,"Meh, it's pretty true. A lot of people called him ""ten loss Tubby"" as early as 2002. He won people back with a fairly strong three years (though without a final four) then had his two most disappointing seasons, and the talent on the roster was taking a nose dive. His biggest claim to fame was his year 1 championship, but a lot of people give Rick Pitino the credit for that roster. (And it's still true that in his 31 year career he never mad a final four with a team he built.) And from what I've seen a lot of people grumbled throughout his tenure for his ""slow, boring"" brand of basketball. 

I have no doubt Barnhart would have given him another year, but things were definitely starting to heat up and Tubby is not a confrontational guy and decided to get a fresh start elsewhere. 

The thing is the group that was discontent was basically right. He moved to schools with ""lower expectations"" and still managed to get fired twice, and was relegated all the way down to High Point where did even worse than the fired guy he replaced.

Hurley very well may stay. Our discussion, that you were adamant in saying it wouldn't happen, was Hurley taking the call and speaking with UK.

He has. He hasn't given them ""No.""

LET ME BE VERY CLEAR.

I don't read that as him coming to UK.

I think this is hearing their offer and seeing if UConn can match or come close. That match could be salary, additional resources and stability. Until he gets that best offer, he's not saying, ""No.""

If he is interested in coming to UK, he's also not going to tell them, ""yes,"" right now with the parade coming up on Saturday. That would leak in a matter of hours and ruin that parade.

UK is waiting on Hurley first. Once his decision is made, then the next dominos will fall.

> One title, 1 championship loss, two final fours, and three elite eights in fifteen seasons ain’t winning big?

First, how many times have we heard ""How long has it been since UK won a title?"" We're an elite program, so we hold ourselves to a different standard and compare ourselves to other elites and the hot programs of the moment. We don't have to be as good as UConn or every good team every year. But if all your status rivals (Duke, UNC, Kansas, UConn, even Nova) are reaching multiple Final Fours and titles in the time since you've made the Final Four, it's not good enough.

Cal's first 6 years were phenomenal, and the only way they could've been greater would've been multiple titles. That may sound unreasonable, but multiple other programs and coaches have achieved it, and not just in bygone eras. Donovan went back to back. UConn has crushed it. Roy, Self, K -- all of them did better than Cal since he last made the Final Four. Their consistency outlasted his magical half-decade. Yes, we made a couple elite 8s after that, but he fell short to elite rivals UNC and UConn and in-conference rival Auburn.

And more importantly, since then, he's not just failed to meet the standard others set or he set early on. He's been an embarrassment. Several of our worst losses in history. Our worst season in history. Consecutive losses that broke records. Upset after upset. All while promising this year would be different and blaming his roster, which he built.

And even if you make excuses for a lot of that, or say college basketball is chaotic and you can't expect him to win more (even though I named several above who did in the same span), he's getting paid more than all of those guys except Self. How many years of embarrassments do that title and early Final Fours buy? 

> 
> Your argument is Cal hasn’t had an elite eight level year in 5 years?
> 
> I guess y’all didn’t know Coach K had several bad years in the row a couple times.

And if Cal had multiple titles, believe me, he'd have gotten a lot less criticism and a lot more understanding. He blew so many opportunities, often with weakness everyone saw coming. Yeah, bad runs happen, but when you keep doing the same thing and blame your roster makeup that you built the way you wanted...

> 
> Bill Self took 14 years between his championships, the first of which was stolen from us (and Cal).

How many times did Self miss the tourney in those 14 years? How many historical losses? (I know Kansas had a run of major upsets in the tourney, and it's why Self had a rival-fan reputation as a choke artist til he got his second title.) And how many future NBA stars did he fail to win a title with? Cal boasts about his 50 NBA players from UK. As rival fans point out, he got one title with guys who have become NBA megastars. ""Oh, but they only played one year in college!"" Yeah, we know. But that talent is his whole system, and if other coaches are winning more consistently the last 5+ years with far less talent, why should we let him use that excuse?
> 
> Most of Cal’s seasons, UK was highly ranked, won most of their games, and just came up short in the NCAA. But Cal is doing something right. It’s not like his fall off like Tubby Smith like.

His early years were so, so good that many people outside of Lexington are failing to remember how really bad these last four have been. Like worse than Billy G's two years by many standards. 

Cal himself, when he was hired at UK, pointed to Billy G's two year's and Tubby's last few and said that was not the standard expected at or deserved by UK. Cal is no where close to that standard now. The only way he tops anyone these last 4+ years is in recruiting. 

NCAA tourney wins in the last 4 tourneys. 1.

SEC tourney wins in the last 4 tourneys. 1.

Champions Classic wins? Don't remember exactly but it's pretty bad.

Wins against Top 10 opponents. Not good.

Three consecutive losses at home for the first time in program history? Yup.

Upsets at home to 300 net opponent? Yup.

Having to rebuild your roster every year because of the way you recruit and coach? Yup.

I'm not gonna pull up all the statistics (they're easy to find around here and Rupp's Rafters if you want), but Cal post-Covid in particular is a far cry from the Cal who put up all those numbers you're pointing to.

How many more first weekend exits or NIT seasons are we supposed to put up with while he makes $9 million a year and says, ""But look at the NBA draft picks!"" While rival fans mock us year after year?

We don't need titles (NCAA or SEC) every year. We just need to be on the same level as the other top 5 programs in the sport. In return we pay our coach so much and support our program so much.

**tl;dr** How many years does he get to embarrass us because he did amazing years ago?

1658,"TKR imo had a bit of a letdown year for all the preseason hype. He had some moments but in a starting role he should have been a bit better on both ends of the floor. I don't think Gillis should have started over him because if TKR gets going he can have a few more minutes but most games it was clear Gillis was going to be closing and getting most of the 2nd half minutes.  If gillis started where is the opening for TKR? You saw how few minutes Furst got in the last 10-15 games, that would have been TKR as Gillis would have ended up playing 30+ mpg.  I think Painter played it as well as he could with the hope that TKR could get going early and provide another option if Edey needed a break or if teams couldn't effectively cover both bigs.  I just wish TKR had more to his game to step out and play away from the rim more than he did. He's smaller than Trevion with less creativity/vision/rebounding/scoring.

Loyer I feel less confident in, and it is partly because he is just so scrawny. He is 6'4"" and just 180. He needs to get stronger so he isn't bullied as much by similar kinds of guards/wings. It would be nice too if he were a bit more consistent and didn't seem to lose his shot for weeks at a time.

Loyer… I really don’t know here. Love his attitude, smart player, I just don’t think he brings enough to the table to be the starter. 

The natty told the entire story, great shooter when he gets wide open looks off the double but that’s not a D1 2-guard skill set. He rarely gets himself open. Loyer didn’t really get notably better or add anything in the offseason from my view.",Smith; Zach; Loyer,Player; Player; Player

They’ll be pretty solid in 2 years when every other team relying on 5-6th years is out of luck and they’re 4th year starters. Cam Spencer is 4 years older than Loyer and pretty good.

A year ago we were absolutely embarrassed by FDU and Painter ran it back with roughly the same bunch and we just had the most successful season in Purdue basketball history.  Thank God Painter isn't as reactionary as some of our fans and didn't burn the house down because of one loss.",UConn; Loyer; Smith; FDU; Painter; Purdue,Team; Player; Player; Team; Coach; Team

1734,I think that's more of an overarching philosophy rather than specific roster tactics for next season.,,
1735,"No idea. He has been at Purdue for 5 seasons including his redshirt year.  And realistically it's not going to get better next year than it was this year. So maybe he just counts his wins and goes to do something different, change of scenery. Edey/Morton were 2 of his best friends and both are leaving.  And Gillis is wrapping up his MBA so he'd have to choose another grad program next year if he wanted to stick around.


I'm most curious if he goes somewhere like ND to play with Coach Shrews or if he goes to an actual contending team.  Either way he's going to have a huge impact on whatever team he chooses.  1 year of having Gillis can fundamentally shape the following 3-4 years based on his leadership and work ethic.

Who cares? College basketball is no longer about the high school recruits. Didn’t the last 5 years teach you anything? Don’t you want more 3-4 year guys? Like we have had 15 years of never knowing a kid for more than 6 months. 

I have never cared about the number of guys to the NBA. It is fine when you win games, but that was Cal’s unraveling. He could have all the talent in the world, but he didn’t develop talent or keep anyone. And every year there were 5-6 freshman that were not going to sit the bench. Even if they should have.

Not only do you have players that took extra years due to COVID - which I think will finally be done playing out next year - you also had a lot of players skip the 2020 NBA Draft because standard evaluations weren't available which played out over the next season or two. So you're had artificially old, skilled rosters filtering out of the game since then. Once that's up the game will trend younger again.

2035,A lot of shitty seniors are out of eligibility,,
2036,"Short answer: We don't, but apparently that doesn't stop us.

Long answer: We have 14 scholarship-level players with eligibility remaining who have yet to enter the portal.

Players from the 2023-24 roster with remaining eligibility: 6

Jordan Butler, Kaleb Brown, Tamar Bates, Trent Pierce, Anthony Robinson, Aidan Shaw

Players who apparently have eligibility left, should they decide to use it (I believe both pending injury waivers for this season): 2 

Caleb Grill, John Tonje

Incoming recruits: 6

Marcus Allen, TO Barrett, Annor Boateng, Trent Burns, Jacob Crews (transfer), Peyton Marshall

So that's 14 players (plus three other traditional walk-ons).

But we've been pretty active in the portal in contacting guys at basically all positions. We've had a couple smaller guards in for visits, we're actively recruiting some bigs, and we've already added a wing player from the portal with more seemingly still being contacted.

It's not clear Brown is even on scholarship at this point, and both Grill and Tonje might be done. We basically had 15 scholarship-equivalent players on this year's roster, so we've shown we can and will use NIL to go past the 13-scholarship max if necessary. (Didn't help much this year, as we lost a few players for the season and sucked as a result.)

There's talk that we'll add as many as five players in the portal, which means we're recruiting for spots that don't exist. Either guys are planning to leave but haven't said anything yet, or our coach is hoping to replace some guys and push them into the portal only after he feels like he has their upgrades in place, which would be unfortunate.

Calipari on the other hand, had a good season where they would have been a 3 seed in the cancelled tournament, a losing season and 3 good, but not great seasons where they lost in the first round twice and the second round once.  

You also throw in the belief that many have that it is harder to win at Baylor than Kentucky with the advantages Kentucky has so the results should improve at Kentucky for Drew just as the results for Tubby improved from Georgia-Kentucky and improved for Calipari from Memphis to Kentucky(at least initially).

The logistical aspects of the department fell apart and it just made the environment difficult for all.

The world is full of highly rated chefs that have never built a successful restaurant, they've only worked for them.  Because no matter how good the food is, it's only part of what it takes to run a restaurant.  And when Cal lost his support staff in DeWayne Peevy and John Robic, he struggled at the other stuff.

Tubby made the tournament every year. Not only that, he never got bounced first round. 6/10 S16, 4/10 E8. His only inferiority (other than recruiting) to Cal was that he only made 1 FF. Tubby did better against teams ranked higher than him than Calipari. He also did good against non-conf P5 schools in comparison to Coach Cal.

Tubby did not recruit well other than the Rondo year, while Cal was the greatest recruiter of all time. Despite Cal's endless NBA talent, they went 76% vs 77% win rate and one championship each. Tubby 5/10 SEC titles, Cal 6/15 SEC titles. As I said before, Tubby has 0 NITs and 0 first round exits. I cannot say that Calipari was better overall without lying. I loved that there were seniors that I got to know over 4 years and got attached to. I miss getting emotional when I saw them get emotional from their successes and failures.

Cat fans shit all over Tubby when he was here (hmmm I wonder why), but I was his staunchest defender on places like WildcatFaithful and RuppRafters on Rivals. I kept hitting them with his stats, and they did not like it. Billy G was supposed to be twice the coach. LOL. Cal was supposed to embarrass me for being so accepting of ""mediocrity"". Yet his mediocrity took us lower than we have ever seen when Tubby was here. I feel vindicated knowing how Cal is exiting, because it's exactly how I predicted all those years ago.

Honestly, the cynical, tired-of-Mitch's-bullshit side of me wouldn't be surprised if Mitch told him to hold out before agreeing and they can get more money for him. Because while a title should be enough, a lot of boosters would rightfully expect to get away with paying Drew far less than they'd be willing to offer a Donovan or Hurley.

The only real problem on our side is that a lot of recruit and transfer options are going to go away the longer this takes. Many would be fine with that if it ends with a stellar coach, but if it drags on and leads to some third-tier choice, heads will roll.

2422,"> How does anybody willingly turn down a job at one of the Big 3 of UNC, Kentucky or Kansas

It's not as bad at UNC or Kansas, but the reality is most of the kinds of coaches you're talking about don't need the brand to succeed, most of the places they're already coaching are more than willing and perfectly able to pay just as much money, and (this is where the Kentucky job really stands out) the pressure to succeed at the highest level in a tournament that is basically a crap shoot is immense. Calipari is the second hall of fame coach that won a national championship that Kentucky has run off in 20 years. A guy like Oats can stay at Alabama, still get his bag, and they will name stadiums after him for a career that would currently be unacceptable at Kentucky.  

Even when Calipari went to Kentucky, Memphis offered him more money than he got there to stay. But Calipari was someone who was viewed as dirty coach and was desperate for the legitimacy that coaching a blood blood could give him and Kentucky was finally desperate enough for success that they were willing to hold their nose and hire him, so that was a just the right guy being available at the right time for exactly the right place.",UNC; Kentucky; Kansas; Calipari; Oats;Alabama; Memphis,Team; Team; Team; Coach; Coach; Team; Team

Rumors were floating around that he had soured some relationships with boosters and he was rubbing some people the wrong way. People started to think the players could tell he was halfway out the door because there was a blatant lack of motivation/passion/effort this season which is usually the opposite of Musselman teams.

Every now and then he gets really excited after a Big W and will grab the mic and yell and not sound too Christian and the announcers are always taken aback when he does that lol, it’s like he breaks character from time to time. 

I have zero doubts about his ability to fit in *anywhere* in the country. He’s extremely intelligent and never puts a foot wrong with what he says or with his public image. He’s squeaky clean after 22 years as a head college coach, which makes me think he either *is* actually squeaky clean, or he’s extremely cunning. Or both.",,

Hypothetically, if he’s able to succeed with a program he built while making as much money as any blue blood would pay him, why would he leave? Also hypothetically, if he continues to succeed but doesn’t get enough support then sure, he’ll likely leave.

No, he probably isn’t a top 10 X’s-and-O’s “coach”, but he’s a top 3-5 recruiter and has built a fucking machine out of our program that was worse off than the SMU football program after they got the death penalty. We might as well have gotten the death penalty for how bad our future looked (that all happened my sister’s freshman year at Baylor, I remember it so well, it was crazy). When he got here we had *maybe* **THREE** players on scholarship after 10 transferred (two of the players who transferred started for final four teams the following season, one was national player of the year), 1 went to prison, and 1 was murdered by the aforementioned prison one. 

Drew’s first recruiting class contained two 3-stars and a no-star, basically guys no one else wanted. But it included Aaron Bruce - a beautiful Aussie who’s probably out there right now absolutely killing it at life with a beautiful broad - who broke the B12 freshman scoring record and was a four year starter and probably somewhere in our top 5 all time scorers list. 

The next year he brings in three 4-stars, our first in program history. All three from Texas within a couple hours’ drive of Waco. All three would start for four years. 

Then, in 2006, he brings in Tweety Motherfucking Carter, the all-time leading scorer in American high school basketball, a 5-star rated PG, and McDonalds All-American. 

That was the game-changer. 

And people say we paid Tweety come here. To those who say that, I will tell them that I know that’s not true cause when Tweety was a freshman at Baylor I was a sophomore at HS in Waco and bought weed from him frequently. He told me on a few occasions that he only sold weed to send money back home since the scholarship only covered school and room & board. And athletes weren’t allowed to get jobs back then.

Tweety’s senior year, and my freshman year at Baylor, he lead us to an Elite 8 where we’d barely lose to eventual national champs Duke. We’d bring in our first 5-star that cycle and then average almost one per year for the next 15 years.

If you're a mid-major school you get the scraps left over from the P5 and are told to be thankful for it while your best players are picked every year. And with unlimited transfers, you can take a guy the P5 didn't want, show he can ball out, and he immediately goes back up.

There's no continuity, there's no reason to feel excited for the future. It's depressing and it sucks as a fan. If you have an exciting freshman the thought isn't ""wow, in 2 years we could do something special,"" it's ""wow, this is our only chance""",,

MVC fans are going to have to embrace NIL or we're going to continue being the farm league for P6 schools. I worry that fans will become jaded and things will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why donate hard earned money to my favorite team's NIL when the best players are just going to transfer out as soon as they get a whiff of success? That's a question a lot of fans of mid and low major programs are asking themselves right now.",MVC,Conference
2997,It's actually 5 coaches.,,
2998,"> I will say this though, it goes in the opposite direction too. When they transferr into the power 5 conferences, that's displacing someone that would have been in that spot. There's necessarily going to be some backflow from kids who ended up on teams where their playing time is going to be limited.

If an MVC guy transfers up and gets minutes over an existing P6 guy, then objectively speaking the MVC guy is better. Even if the existing P6 guy transfers down, he's not going to light the world on fire in the MVC if he wasn't good enough to retain his minutes on a P6 team.

Can’t you people just say, “good for them?” Why do you people feel the need to go try to make excuses for the men’s game by complaining about start time and networks?

Stop fucking airing the men’s championship with a start time of 9:20pm (eastern) on a Monday night! I watched the first half but have to be up for work in the morning, no way I can stay up for the whole thing. What the hell are media execs thinking with that schedule. ",Caitlin Clark,Player

The lack of overall parity increases interest in later rounds for the women.

“Worth remembering that ESPN has had the rights to the women’s basketball tournament for decades and only now is giving the game the profile, resources and shoulder programming it deserved. Which only hurt its own investment. Remember that when you see the ratings for these games. It’s something I witnessed first hand there, and I also witnessed a lot of incredible advocates for women’s coverage who had a hard time finding real traction. And at the same time, ESPN has done more women’s coverage, and hired more women, than any other network.” -Jane McManus, a former ESPN columnist, via hollywoodreporter

3326,"People here are so scared to admit that the men’s game is dying because of the NBA, NIL, and transfer portal. 

The women’s game is more compelling because players have to stay for 4 years and are more often committed to their teams and coaches. It creates rivalries, storylines, and draws attention. 

People started paying attention to Clark last March. Had she been in MBB she likely would’ve been drafted, shuffled away to summer league, and largely forgotten by the college game. She had an entire extra season to cement her legacy and break records, while garnering a “rivalry” against Angel Reese and then South Carolina. The same can and will be said about the likes of Juju Watkins, Bueckers, Fulwiley, etc. 

It’s much harder to keep up with a game when the players are different every single year.",Clark; Angel Reese;South Carolina; Juju Watkins; Bueckers; Fulwiley,Player; Player; Team; Player; Player; Player

3356,They'd lose more viewers moving the final 4 from Saturday to Friday than they'd gain moving the title game from Monday to Sunday. That's why they don't do it.,,

3358,"My guess is that a lot more people won't watch a game at all, if they miss the first 30 minutes.  

At least compared with those people who turn off a game because it's too late at night.

So on balance, it's better to start later.  The west coast people don't ignore the game outright to do something else. The east coast people suffer, but are still willing to watch the ending.",,

Imagine if you had like a 7 Eastern tip. That's 4 Pacific. There are tons of people in the West Coast with hour plus commutes. Some would miss the game entirely, and many would just get home for the final few minutes. Even an 8 Easterm tip is going to result in lots of people missing the first half. They could potentially tially move the tip to something like 9 flat rather than 9:20, but when you go earlier than that you're starting to actually fuck over those on the West Coast, as opposed to mildly inconveniencing those on the East Coast with later start times.",,
3363,"Probably has to do with gate revenue too if it’s on a Monday gotta give people time to get there after work in the local time zone 




Never mind just found out it’s always been that way, weird!",,
3364,"Tradition, basically. ""It's been that way for years, why change it?"" - NCAA and Turner/CBS

I know it's a different sport but ESPN has been pretty receptive on moving the kickoff of the CFP championship up because of game length and complaints about how late the game went (typically ending after Midnight on the East Coast). Kickoff used to be 8:30 ET - we're now kicking off at 7:45 ET.

The complaints about the tip time have been a thing for a while (and frankly, I think the game should tip at 8:30 or 8:45 ET) but until there's enough complaints from talking head pundits about how late the tip is, it's probably not changing.",,
3365,the men have no gripping stories and a bad gametime.,,
3366,Are you more likely to stay up late or leave work early to watch a national championship game your team isn’t in?,,
3367,"Try thinking about the West Coast perspective for a second. Many people on the West Coast have hour plus commutes. So if they leave work at 5, many are getting home at like 6-6:30. If a major sports game started at, say, 7 Eastern, that would be 4 Pacific. Meaning the game would be mostly over by the time many on the West Coast get home.

So yeah, late start times might mildly inconvenience the East Coast. But an early start time would *completely* fuck over the West Coast.

3369,"they had storylines, if it was 4 rando teams due to a lot of upsets it would have been a snoozefest",,
3370,I knew more women players than men this year.  That has never happened 🤣,,
3371,"Yeah the way it worked out was perfect for max drama.  First off had 2 teams go to back to back final 4s, something I don't think has happened in the mens tournament since 2015.  They had a championship rematch in the Elite 8, Iowa faced off vs the most dominant program in the sport in the final 4 and then a Final 4 rematch in the championship.  That's the dream scenario basically (other than flipping the UConn and LSU matchups).

Think of that 2014-2015 tournament.  2014 Wisconsin beat Arizona by 1 in overtime but then get upset by Kentucky in the Final 4 when Kentucky was the 8 seed.  Then the next year once again Wisconsin beat Arizona in the Elite 8 and then this year they get revenge and beat the undefeated Kentucky team.  Now throw in there a player that's as nationally relevant as Clark and you'd have crazy ratings.

Say what you want about the WNBA not allowing players to go pro till they stay 4 years (or maybe 3 I'm not sure) but it allows for more of these recognizable faces to rematch and go back for revenge in the tournament.  It's different when it's 2 schools playing each other back to back years when most of the good players are gone from last year than when both teams kept basically the same starting 5 or at least the stars.",Iowa; UConn; LSU; Kentucky;Wisconsin; Arizona; Clark,Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Player

Duke/State MBB and Women’s National title are also similar in timeslot (men started a little later) and OTA.

Very clear that the WBB tournament was, at minimum, of equal interest after the first weekend.

The move of making the WBB Final Four/Champ from Sunday/Tuesday to Friday/Sunday was also a smart change.

There’s a lot of things the Men’s game could take from the Women’s to make their product more entertaining. Switch to quarters and decrease coach timeouts. Put players more front and center (halftime interviews with players). Allow advancement of the ball with timeouts. Unfortunately, the rules committee is made up of mostly coaches who don’t want to change.

The Women’s Tournament also has the advantage of having stars having to play 3 years before being WNBA-eligible. And, sadly, that WNBA salaries pale in comparison to what a major star could get in NIL (that part is not sad, the WNBA salary is).

With CFB, it's a little difference because of how much longer the games are. If you go past midnight, that's when you get to the point where many actually will turn the game off.",,
3461,"There’s a reasonable middle ground between the two, even on a week night. Around 8:15-8:30p seems significantly more reasonable (Monday Night Football for instance is an 8:15p kickoff). And if you put the big game on not a weekday/work night that is extremely helpful as well.

Personally I think NCAA Women’s Final Four and Finals should play Thu/Sat, and NCAA Men’s should play Fri/Sun, all at reasonable times, and I think they’d probably see bigger viewership numbers across the board.",,

However, with success comes the same problems that the men's game has: i.e. money makes people leave early and fuels the transfer portal.

So if the women's game loses that loyalty and familiarity benefit does it lose its edge over the men?",,

You are arguing that the B1G didn't choose this of their own volition, and that they were forced/pressured to scuttle it for Fox in order to begin negotiating with the B12. If that is true then the B12 entered into negotiations with the Big East, knowing that they couldn't reach a deal because Fox didn't want to. 

  
So either the Big East negotiated with both conferences and both conferences decided that they didn't want to play the Big East on their own, or Fox pressured them and at least the B12 negotiated with the Big East knowing they couldn't accept any offers. 



I guess there is a third option where the B1G backed out for their own reasons, and then Fox seized on this and pressured the B12 to back out in order to set up a B12 B1G battle but again there doesn't seem to be a plausible scenario where both the B12 and B1G were forced/pressured by Fox and neither negotiated in bad faith, knowing they couldn't accept a deal.",Big East; B1G; B12,Conference; Conference; Conference

It comes from a term referring to aristocrats with a long history of noble blood. Pampered rich people who had pale skin from never having to work outside, therefore making it easy to see their blue veins. Royal families are super snotty and clique; they don’t allow someone to join just because their family became rich 25 years ago. You need a long history for that.

You can’t be a blue blood because you win a bunch recently. In 30 years, yes they would be one. They can’t become one fast. UConn wouldn’t be a blue blood even if they won the title the next five years.

Just trying to make UK the primary school for everyone in the state to support. And it mostly worked. Outside the Louisville area UK holds dominion pretty much everywhere, and even inside of Louisville its more divided than most would assume.

Louisville for their part wanted to play UK, badly. Especially as their program was rising they wanted a shot to take UK down and make a name for themselves. As UK still refused to schedule UofL's coach Denny Crum would take shots as often as he could about how UK was too scared to play them. 

Ultimately the two finally met in the tournament, which is locally called the ""Dream Game"" (especially in Louisville), which UofL won in overtime, and they obviously felt it vindicated all their claims over the past years. 

In the post-loss wake embarrassment, UK basically said ""fine, you want to play, let's do this shit"" and went to to win roughly 70% of the games in the series thereafter.",UK; Louisville; UofL; Denny Crum,Team; Team; Team; Coach

Was Adolph Rupp racist? Sure, at least a little. But the dude was born in 1901 in the middle of bumfuck Kansas. Of course he was a little racist. It was the environment he was raised in. But if you look at his full record it's not nearly as bad as your vilification would indicate.  Recruiting black players into the SEC at the time was not a straightforward task. Bringing them on the road to places like Mississippi would be actively dangerous. Even so, he had unsuccessfully recruited several black players for years before the first one signed on. He can't exactly be held fully at fault for people choosing to not sign up. And when the south wasn't an issue, he actually coached a black player in *1929* in Illinois, and was instrumental in getting the first black player on team USA in 1948. He even asked the university president to leave the SEC so he could recruit black players. 

All this is well documented as well, but it doesn't fit your narrative so you conveniently left it off. Yes, he clearly wasn't without racism, but compared to his background and contemporaries he was arguably racially progressive.",Rupp; UofL; Adolph Rupp; Illinois;SEC,Coach; Team; Coach; Team; Conference

But I don't doubt that racism was an issue, Louisville was recruiting black players earlier, and regardless of real racism issues in the SEC or potential issues with Rupp -- there were likely major issues in the fanbase at a time with racism was the norm.  


While now the debate has degraded to name calling, racial tension was a part of that rivalry for many until it wasn't.  And while Louisville was a more accepting school, and Rupp sent black players he scouted in the direction of Louisville -- there are undoubtedly stains of racism not just on Kentucky or Lousiville, but on schools around the country.

The reality for GU basketball is it has lost most of its national relevance.  To a large degree it has also become an afterthought among sports fans in the DC area.  (Disclosure note: I live in the DC area, though I’m not native to the area.)  Some people at GU may think they have little to gain by playing GW, but the GU program has fallen so far they also have little more to lose.

If Georgetown wants to generate more local/regional interest in its program, playing one of its two most logical regional rivals (Maryland is the other) and one that has some strong similarities as an academic institution and is located 1 1/2 miles away would definitely help do that.  Just play the game at Capital One Arena but treat the game as a neutral site game and split the tickets 50/50.  I suspect many, many people on both sides as well as many college basketball fans in the DC area will come out of the woodwork to attend.

Big John Thompson (Jr.) is dead and buried.  Georgetown has become largely irrelevant and needs to find ways to get some of that relevance back.

Smith/purdue in the first half of the season was much better at rhythm and movement.  Less assists for smith but a lot more good looks for everyone else.

They rank 4th in average KenPom ranking (13.13). They have 4 B1G championships, 5 Sweet 16s, 2 Elite Eights, a Final Four, and a runner-up.

I didn't say 8x the amount of final fours, there's a concatenate there bud. My point was Cal appeared far more often than Drew, hence the hyperbole.

Calipari: 17 years, two separate teams (3 & 4 years each to build up)

* Elite 8's: 94, 95, 05, 06, 07
* Final Fours: 95, 07

Scott Drew: 20 years, one school (4 years before first round of 64)

* Elite 8: 09, 11, 20
* Final four: 20

So in 11 years Cal had 6 Elite 8's, and two final fours, and a runner up to Drew in 16 having 3 Elite 8's, one final four, and a title. And if you go by Sweet 16's it's;

* Calipari: 91, 94, 95, 05, 06, 07, 09 or 7/11 (63%) of seasons (41% unadjusted)
* Drew: 09, 11, 13, 16 20, or 5/16 (31%) of seasons (25% unadjusted)

So how, Mr. Alter, is that ""still better than Cal""...?

Cal's resume was nuts and without the gap of 1996-2000 he would have even more with either team playing like they were.

Explain how it's not the top job. 

On the day of the National Title game, the sports world was focused on UK and Cal. On the day after the most dominant tourney run of the modern era, the main story is ""Who does UK get? Can they get Hurley""?

Hurley just last week complained about how UConn doesn't get the same exposure as UK, Duke, UNC, Kansas and Gonzaga.

UConn is not a top job. It's a good job, but it does not have the money, resources or brand that UK has.

>Again, money isn’t everything, especially when Hurley’s gonna get a bump from us anyways. Some people have no interest in living in Kentucky or dealing with Kentucky fans just as other people would have to live in Connecticut or deal with Connecticut fans.

His agent cares because it's more money for the agent and Hurley's best interest to listen. Leverage matters.

I'm not saying he's taking the job, either. Family situation does play into this some, see Billy Donavan in '07 and '09.

>And not to get political on a hoops sub, but let’s be real for a second, the south is not for everyone. You could offer me the exact same job for twice the pay in Kentucky and there’s no way I’m taking it. My family is all in the Northeast, it’s where I grew up and spent almost my whole life in. What makes people happy varies. It really does seem Like Hurley found his dream job, and UK ain’t what it used to be, and unless you’re in your late 70s, I’ve been alive for more UConn titles than you have been for Kentucky ones.

Cost of living wise, if you got twice the pay, you could move your entire family down to Lexington.

Have you ever been there?

It's one of the most scenic places in the country because of the horse farms around the city and the mountains just a little over an hour south.

As for the ""not to get political"" comment, your inference of the south comes off as pretty ignorant.

Maybe Hurley does stay because he loves it there. My point is Monday's comments were a big nothing bag until his actions back it up.

You may not agree with any of this, but that doesnt matter, because Hurley does.

-Big East basketball >>>>> all other college basketball

-Storrs South aka Madison Square Garden is the best place for a conference tourney possible

-The northeast (specifically Jersey where he and his wife are both from) is the best place in the US to live. Both of their families are here, and family is everything to him

-He doesn't want players who are interested in getting a bag. He wants players who want to play basketball and win rings. He's talked about part of why he loves Castle so much was he's the anti-five star recruit and how his recruitment was never once about the bag he'd get

-His players are his children, and he doesn't want his children to go to a school ranked 159th in the country

-The Dairy Barn has the best ice cream in the world (ok, this one is a joke and I don't even believe it, but if you don't know what the Dairy Barn even is, stop acting like you have anywhere close to the knowledge I have on UConn that I do)

-Kentucky fans are worse than UConn fans, and his wife thinks they're as bad as Providence fans. Name me a time UConn fans ran off a Hall of Fame coach with a lifetime contract

Again, doesn't matter if you buy into any of this. Hurley does. But feel free to keep thinking about how Hurley, Oats, Donovan, Wright all spurned your ""top job in basketball.""

So looking at other numbers: UConn ranks 23rd in all-time wins, 20th in win percentage, and 17th in final four appearances. Meanwhile the traditional blue bloods (IMO - Kentucky, Duke, UNC, UCLA, Kansas) are **top five in all categories**.

So are they a blue blood? The numbers pretty definitively say *no*. But that doesn't take anything away from what they have accomplished and the respect people should have for the program in 2024.",Kentucky; UConn; Duke; UNC; UCLA,Team; Team; Team; Team; Team

To me, the history of basketball is still too short for 25 years to establish that kind of history.

I think the big problem here is that everyone has a different definition, and for a lot of people it's ""the top tier of the sport"". In my opinion, blue bloods are the teams that are important to the entire history of basketball, not just the recent history.

In short I think blue blood doesn't equal good team. There are blue bloods who have not been good in a while (sorry Indiana) and there are, to extend the metaphor, ""nouveaux riche"" teams (Duke, UConn).",Indiana; Duke; UConn,Team; Team; Team

Since 2006 UConn has missed the national tournament 8 times and got eliminated in the first round in 4 more. For UNC, Duke, Kentucky or KU missing the tournament is a fluke and humiliation for the program. For UConn its routine, even during its supposed golden era.

5460,"The unusual thing about UConn is that they don’t fit the archetype in any sense except for national championships (I wouldn’t even say overall tournament success, for reasons I’ll say below)

To be clear, after last night, UConn deserves to be called a blue blood at this point. But every other blue blood, and even stretching out to the top *ten* consistently good teams, those teams maintain 70%+ win rates almost every year in the regular season, make the tournament virtually every year, and get a championship every 15-30 years or so, maybe 7-15 years for blue bloods. This sort of pattern is followed by almost every consistently good team.

Except UConn. UConn has missed the tournament *entirely* SEVEN times in the last 25 years, and won SIX championships during that time. That’s twice as much as anyone else over the same period. They are now tied for 3rd overall in number of championship victories, but they’ve appeared  in *less than half* as many title games as any other blue blood, on average. Most blue bloods maintain roughly a 50/50 win rate in title games, but UConn is undefeated. All of their wins came within the last 25 years.

Here are the win percentages of the 4 major blue bloods and UConn in the last 25 years. Title appearances column is all time to emphasize the win rate discrepancy.

| School  | Ovr W% | Tourn. % | All Title App. | Title Wins Since ’99 |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Kansas  | 82.8%  | 100%     | 10             | 2              |
| Duke    | 78.3%  | 100%     | 11             | 3              |
| UNC     | 72.9%  | 91.67%   | 11             | 3              |
| Kentucky| 75.4%  | 87.5%    | 12             | 1              |
| UConn   | 69.0%  | 70.83%   | 6              | 6             |

This table illustrates to me why UConn doesn’t fit the blue blood archetype in literally any way except for
Number of titles won… but that happens to be the most important stat, especially in the modern interpretation. They’re confidently the worst in every stat by a noticeable margin of these teams, and yet they’ve won twice as many titles as anyone in all of college over that time. This is why they don’t feel like a blue blood, even though they look like one when you only look at titles. These numbers can go deeper to elucidate the cognitive dissonance, if you start looking at raw strength of schedule numbers and conference championships. UConn appears even worse in those measures.",UConn; Kansas; Duke; UNC; Kentucky,Team; Team; Team; Team; Team

They're basically just Florida or Michigan at this point.",UCLA; Indiana; Florida; Michigan,Team; Team; Team; Team
5481,"But UConn has not had 25 years of sustained excellence. Since 2007 they missed the national tournament 8 times and got eliminated in the first round 4 more times. I agree that *sustained* excellence is what gets you blue blood status, but UConn has not had that.",UConn,Team
5482,We understand the hate.  Kansas fans are particularly good at displaying it as they scramble to justify their blue-bloodedness while UConn passes them by as the best program of the last 30 years.,Kansas; UConn,Team; Team
5483,"Respectfully, I disagree. Acknowledging I am in the vast minority of people, I do not recognize Duke as a blue-blood just yet for the same reason people think UCLA and Indiana are no longer blue bloods (also a proposition with which I disagree; joining the club comes with a lifetime membership, which is part of the reason it needs to be a high bar to get in). That reason is: recency bias. People say ""UCLA and IU are out because they haven't done anything recently."" Another way of saying that is ""UCLA hasn't proven that its history is bigger than the Wooden years, and IU hasn't proven that its history is bigger than the Knight years."" Thus, for similar reasons, I believe Duke has yet to prove its stamp on college hoops history is more than the Krzyzewski years. And because I believe blue-blood status relates back with no expiration, it's a higher bar to get in in the first place. Hence, Duke? Not yet in the club for me.

But what keeps UConn out is not the same thing that keeps Duke out. Banners aren't enough. If they were, then we would be talking about programs like Oklahoma State, Florida, Michigan State and Villanova having claims to blue blood status, too. So we look at what distinguishes the undisputed blue bloods (KU/UNC/UK/UCLA) from the programs with multiple title banners but we all agree don't *really* pass the sniff test to be called blue bloods, like the Floridas and Michigan States. The answer to that question is more subjective, but seems to be a similarly-high bar: what is your program's contribution *to* the game. Not what is your program's achievement *within* the game, but how did your program change the game itself, or how does your program transcend title banners or W-L record? 

And that's what keeps UConn out. It can't claim winningest program of all time. It can't claim most titles. It can't claim a uniquely historical run, such as an undefeated season or back-to-back titles. It can't claim Final Four appearances in every decade. It can't claim a deep-rooted coaching tree. It can't claim some kind of historical impact on the game itself, like rule changes. For Duke, they get to claim the GOAT - Coach K's the winningest *coach* of all time, and while he didn't roll off a Wooden-esque five-in-a-row, he made his bones in the 64-team and 68-team eras without the benefit of geographical regionals. Even if you don't acknowledge K as *better* than Wooden, you have to acknowledge him as being the only coach who is Wooden's equal when accounting for differences in eras.

Now, just because I can't come up with UConn's X-factor doesn't mean there isn't one. Maybe it just means I don't know what it is. But the fact that fans of undisputed blue-bloods tend to know other blue-bloods' histories suggests UConn doesn't have one.",Duke; UCLA; Indiana; IU; Wooden; Knight; Krzyzewski; Oklahoma State; Florida; Michigan State; Villanova; UConn; KU; UNC; UK; UCLA; Coach K; K,Team; Team; Team; Team; Coach; Coach; Coach; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Team; Coach; Coach

People put WAY too much meaning into the term Blue Blood. Maybe because it sounds cooler than ""Elite Program."" The term Blue Blood refers to aristocratic families that have been wealthy & powerful for many generations. Think of the Kennedys, Rockefellers or Vanderbilts.

The tournament is so random it's honestly kind of weird how UConn has been able to go on these runs without many sweet 16s or elite 8s.

UConn is a blue blood. There's no other way around it. Kentucky had absolutely no shot and it was almost laughable to think they actually believed they had a shot at Hurley.

5831,"I think when was Duke considered a Blue Blood is a more important question.

It looks like [Duke](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2022-04-02/origin-term-blue-bloods-college-basketbal) was considered a blue-blood in 1990 before winning any championships.

Duke had a winning percentage of .597 at that time for its first 85 years of being a program and no Championships. Prior to 1990 they had only made the finals 3 times, been in 7 final fours and been in 9 elite eights.

Meanwhile UConn currently has a winning percentage of .644; they have 6 Championships, 7 final fours and 13 elite eights.

So UConn has +.047 record against ""Blue Blood Duke"", +6 Championships on ""Blue Blood Duke"", even on final fours and +4 elite eights against Duke of 1990. Hell they have double the championship appearances of Duke by that point in their history.

I didn't say Duke was a blue blood in 1990. I said they already had plenty of accolades before K. 

Anyway, you can't strictly look at cumulative numbers now vs. 1990 when 35 years more of potential accomplishments have accumulated for every program out there. UConn is being compared against what other programs have accomplished up to 2024, there is no set cumulative threshold for a blue blood worthy number of championships. In 200 years from now, if college hoops persist, 6 championships will not be enough for anybody. 

But let's look at 1992 after 2 Duke championships. Let's take the 3 universally accepted blue bloods, UCLA who is nearly universally accepted, and for comparison's sake let's include Louisville who is outside the blue blood convo but in the next tier, and has had fairly consistent success across eras even into the 21st century (i.e., not concentrated into the past or present to skew anything). Also, I only list all time rank for the AP stat as that's the only one that was readily available to me.

Anyways, we were then independents and after the NCAA ruled against the ECAC tournaments for Eastern independents to get automatic berths to the NCAAs, we ended up in the Big East because of our market and then nearly-rebuilt Hartford Civic Center.

As for BC, they hired Gary Williams over Northeastern’s Boston-bred coach, one Jim Calhoun. To this day, he abhors them and when Williams went to Ohio State, Calhoun took the UConn job over the BC one.

As for realignment, the old Big East had a similar situation with Penn State. We rejected them when they wanted to join (this was almost entirely due to horrible timing).

And for the most part, it’s not close. The gap between #5 and #6 in FF appearances, is 5- that’s just two appearances shy from matching UConn’s entire historical output.

That’s just about the same gap as #6 (1993 wins total) and #50 (Mizzou, 1691).

It’s not a “new barrier to entry” imo, it’s that Blue Blood is synonymous with sustained long-term success.

I don't think that comes up to the same level, but again, if other people think it should we can have that debate.

I don't think the social media manager at KU Athletics is the arbiter of which programs are or are not blue-bloods.

I think we have to be careful when we use phrases like ""*historically* winning,"" because the history of college hoops goes back a lot further than 1999 and, even with the last 25 years, UConn only ranks #23 on the all-time wins list. UConn has had a lot of good six-game streaks, obviously. But it's also missed the tourney completely almost 1/3 of the time in that same span (8 no-shows in last 25 years).

As for Duke's claim, I don't disagree. For me personally, I don't put Duke among the blue bloods for exactly the reason you suggest. However, I acknowledge that my paradigm is very much a minority opinion, so I include what arguably makes Duke a blue-blood already. And simply stated - Duke's in a better position than UConn. The *only* thing Duke has to do to solidify itself as a blue-blood, in my opinion, is win one more natty to show it's a championship program even without Coach K. But UConn demonstrates *why* titles aren't the only factor to be considered in granting admission to the club. In 2011, UConn proved that the season doesn't matter as long as you get hot for nine games in March. Their *only* shot that year was an AQ bid, and they ran it to a title. And the Kevin Ollie year? Does anybody view that run as anything other than fluky with Ollie babysitting a bunch of Calhoun's recruits? That doesn't take away from the achievement. The rings were earned fair and square. But it goes to show that there's more to it than having a few great six-game runs across the entire sport since the first intercollegiate hoops game in 1895.",KU; UConn; Coach K; Duke; Kevin Ollie; Calhoun,Team; Team; Coach; Team; Coach; Coach

Also, comparisons are important because there are definitely minimums required for anything. The first college to play a varsity basketball game was either Geneva College or Vanderbilt. Geneva College is currently in the D3 Presidents’ Athletic Conference composed of tiny private liberal arts colleges in Western Pennsylvania, while Vanderbilt is the doormat of the SEC. Yet surely they (along with Springfield College, where Dr. James Naismith invented basketball) would have been they would have been the best (and worst) basketball programs in 1893 as they were the only ones, right?

Five of the blue bloods have unique claims:

Kansas’ worst coach was Dr. James Naismith himself. Among their alumni are Wilt Chamberlain, Dean Smith, and Adolph Rupp.

Kentucky was the first Southern (well, border state at least) school to win an NCAA tournament and also has the most wins.

UNC has had success (including titles) under multiple coaches over a long period of time. They actually beat Wilt in a 57-54 3OT National Championship game in 1957. Four corners offense!

UCLA has the most titles and the two best candidates for the college MBB GOAT: Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton. Also, John Wooden wasn’t a slouch either

Indiana has the last undefeated season and a long-established history (first title in 1940). They also have history under multiple coaches.

Which leaves us with Duke: known as a perennial choker until 1991, all success under one coach, only five titles, and they seem to have forced their way into the blue blood fraternity instead of asking for acceptance.

I feel like Duke is the closest comparable to UConn.

6467,"The ""basketball school"" comment, while overblown, was such an unforced error. Cal smartly used the UCLA offer to get the best and biggest contract in college basketball history. Just a few years later, amidst a string of successful seasons by other sports at the school and coming on the heels of a miserable 9-16 season and a loss to St. Peter's, he uncharacteristically put his foot in his mouth. All he had to say was ""Kentucky's supposed to be a basketball powerhouse"" or ""Kentucky's supposed to be a basketball blue blood.""

It all tracks with a change after the UCLA offer though. Folks on this subreddit are probably pretty plugged in, but the average sports fan might not realize how combative and toxic it had all become over the past few seasons. After losing to Tennessee at Rupp this season, he skipped the post-game radio show altogether, which had become increasingly common. Then, after a terrific win at Auburn a few weeks later, he gave an utterly bizarre performance to the press that has to be seen to be believed.

The performance had slipped, but to his credit, Cal was still very plugged in to humanitarian and charitable causes around the state. Everyone should be forever grateful for that. If he hadn't become so weirdly combative and confrontational, then I think he'd still be here. The lunatics would still be raving, and more mainstream fans would probably be grumbling a little bit, but I think most of the fanbase would still be optimistic if not overly excited.

He *owned* the first decade of the 1-and-done era. Derrick Rose was the first one. #1 recruit in the country, could’ve gone #1 in the draft out of HS but they changed the rule so he went to Memphis with Cal and almost led them to a title 

Then my senior year of HS there are rumors of Drew to UK, meanwhile Cal had probably the best recruiting class of all time his last class at Memphis, but then took them to Kentucky with him - it was insane. 

That was my senior year of HS so I was getting so pumped about college basketball since I was going to Baylor and Baylor had just made the tournament for the first time in decades and people finally realized Drew was a Messiah. 

But Calipari, Wall, and Boogie going to UK was like LeBron/Wade/Bosh going to Miami. I’ll never forget that. Baylor were in Wall’s top 3 so I followed that cycle super closely.

And it must’ve been Memphis I was thinking of that was after him at that time, not UK. I remember that article. It gave him a bad rep for a few years, which was very undeserved. It brought up the old story about him negatively recruiting against fellow B12 coaches from his first couple of years (he sent recruits a flyer saying he was the only coach in the B12 who had recruited a McDonalds All American which included pictures of Bob Knight and Bill Self X’d out; to be fair, it was true at the time; Tweety Carter baby!). Then everyone thought he was paying players to come here after we got our first ever 5-star (Perry fucking Jones III) so there was some negativity around him again from opposing fans. 

But none of it was ever warranted. He rubbed some old heads wrong when he was in his low 30’s (Bob Knight approached him at media days - or the conference tournament, I forget - and grabbed him by the collar and chewed him out about it; he’s probably the one who fed that info to the Memphis journalist), that happens in the workplace. 

Generations clash and disagreements over how things should be done arise, it’s whatever in my book.

Meanwhile, Arkansas has been left with literally zero scholarship players since Muss left. Not. A. Single. One!  However, with Coach Cal's recruiting prowess, the Hogs should be loaded up with talent in no time flat. Imagine how long it would take to rebuild our team under practically anybody else. We faced potentially years and years of rebuilding. With no telling whom as our coach. (Thank goodness we dodged hiring Chris ""Austin Strangler"" Beard. Yes, yes, I meant *alleged* strangler!)

And let's just say Arkansas gets about five good years with Coach Cal, maybe one or two of which could be great, or dare I say it, perhaps even one spectacular tournament run. Most of our fans would be satisfied with that. And then we'll just bring in another great coach. The floor for our coach's salary and NIL has been significantly raised to bring in superstar talent.

When you're promising minutes to recruits instead of basing your rotation on mainly seniors/juniors, you're going to get demolished by the good teams. Harder to coach, some of what you do is not necessarily to win, but develop for the next level, and the teams with seniors are just smarter, better basketball players at that level.

7742,"Hypothetically, if Painter takes out Edey, and goes 4 guards and 1 more mobile big man. I still don't think we score more efficiently or defend more efficiently.

Then hope that he scores, or gets doubled and throws out to an open shooter. Instead we run a lot more cuts and screens and Carsen Edwards like disregard for distance from goal. But that's not what we have played all season. We maybe could have trapped and pressed the whole game (think PressVirginia) and see if that tired them out first, but we hadn't played that all season... I think 7/10 times same refs and same environment, UConn wins anyway. Painter did a good job, but excellent was what we needed.

well, he will have to. theres not another edey on this roster.  even if will berg steps in to that spot (he wont.

could be off on this, but i think having edey kind of limited painters realistic options to a point.  you dont have a player that dominant, that efficient, and that game-breaking and not run your offense through him every single game.  painter has run very good action for guards before when the guards were purdues game changers (edwards/cline year, for example), but that certainly wasnt the case this year.

purdue has also recruited better athletes recently, so just by that, the team should look pretty different on offense next year, hopefully more free flowing and better spacing without edey in the game to control the offense.  even starting TKR would require a significant transition on offense.

going to be a rough few months i think with so many starting minutes up for grabs, but expect purdue to be back in the tournament next year, maybe as a 5 or 6 seed.",Painter; TKR; edey; berg; painter; purdue; edwards; cline,Coach; Player; Player; Player; Coach; Team; Player; Player

7875,I remember when Kemba signed at UConn he had some quote (can’t find it) about how every other coach who recruited him kissed his ass while Calhoun told him he’d was nothing and would have to earn every minute of playing time. Kemba obviously chose the latter. Castle has that kind of mentality. He found a coach/team/system he trusts and found a way to be part of it.

I think it's hard to overstate how important of a playmaker Smith is. We just never seem to have all the puzzle pieces all at once.


And yeah...UConn's guards were to ours what Zach Edey was to every center we played against all year. The fact that they had Clingan on top of that is just unfair, lol.",Jaden Ivey; Zach Edey; Smith; Zach; UConn; Clingan,Player; Player; Player; Player; Team; Player

Even if he had gone 32/54, That's all twos and still only 64 points, But even if you account for say, 8 free throws, That's still 72 points and three points lower than what Uconn scored. 

The problem with this hypothetical is there's no way he would shoot that well. 

Too many of the attempts would be terrible looks and also, the increased volume of possessions where he's required to dig deep to get into good position equals more fatigue. 

The only chance Purdue had was getting clingan into foul trouble really early, imo.",Uconn; Purdue; clingan,Team; Team; Player
7884,"Yeah, sticking with the plan eventually led to all the dominos falling.  I got a little worried when we started getting into foul trouble with almost 10 min left, but Edey was tired and the rest of the team startes to panic a little so we were able to maintain.

One part of the plan that gets overlooked a little is that by playing 1v1 with Clingan, it helped Uconn to out rebound Purdue.  Edey outplayed Clingan offensively, but Clingan boxed him out well enough by himself to allow our bigger guards to get rebounds.",Edey; Clingan; Uconn; Purdue,Player; Player; Team; Team

While I think Hurley is a good in game coach, UConn won these two championships with the less sexy parts of coaching in practices and war room.

7889,"Although it might not have made a difference, the one thing I did question Painter on was their full court press. UConn literally beat it the same way nearly every single time. It was like watching a replay. Karaban would pass to Newton. Purdue would send Karaban’s man to double Newton. Newton would pass it over to Karaban. Purdue would run towards Karaban, and he would throw it to an open guy at half court. And Purdue literally never did anything else.

I know that Purdue probably didn’t press teams very often this year. I know that UConn has very talented guards. But like wtf? Do they literally only have one press play in the playbook?

Some years that guy is Carsen Edwards or Jaden Ivey. Some years it is Zach Edey or Swanigan. That's how most teams operate. UConn is an anomaly, and it isn't really something you can just replicate. They're literally one of the greatest teams ever.",Painter; Carsen Edwards; Jaden Ivey; Zach Edey; Swanigan; UConn,Coach; Player; Player; Player; Player; Team
7906,"He talked about it in the post game press conference. Their guards were excellent defenders. They had length and athleticism on us. They were also playing extremely tight to prevent us from taking shots. We could barely get open in the first half. They were handling our screens and sets. The few times we got open looks for half a second, we didn't pull the trigger instantly.

Then we had to play to limit their transition offense, so we didn't want to jack up bad 3s. Bad 3s are long rebounds that UConn uses to go on a 30-0 run. This game featured a bunch of 5-2 trading because we couldn't buy a rebound due to the athletic guard discrepancy plus Clingan being such a hard matchup for Edey. 

The game plan was that we match up worse at guard than them, so we have to open the game with Edey's scoring. He scores. We get a stop. We get a rebound. He scores. They double him because he'll just keep scoring and extending or maintaining the lead. He kicks out for 3. 

The problem is, we'd get the stops and not the rebounds. So we couldn't build a lead to force the double. And that's a credit to them being totally locked in. And then, they run their long sets with off ball movement, and they're bigger and faster than we are, so we are getting gassed trying to run around for 30 seconds. Then they get it off the offensive glass and it's another 20. Then we have to go up the court with Castle on Smith just pressuring him for 40 minutes. 

They just physically outmatched us in a way that literally no other team has been able to. But I think they would have outmatched any team in the country.",UConn; Clingan; Edey; Castle; Smith,Team; Player; Player; Player; Player

At this point all you can do is add maybe one or two new sets.  You don’t want to be running new things against a defense like UConns who will pick apart any mistake.   

Pushing the pace isn’t something that would have been in Purdues favor.  Similar to how the press wasn’t. They would have been mauled if they tried to run with UConn.  I would have enjoyed that immensely.  

All the stuff you are talking about is stuff Purdue doesn’t run, or at least didn’t during the season. Trying it in the NC game would have been a recipe for even more punishment.  

But hey, as a UConn fan I would have loved to see it.",Uconn; Purdue; NC,Team; Team; Team

They didn’t have the athletes to play the same type of defense UConn has the last two years.  That is what really made them special.

It’s why I’m annoyed with the Caitlin Clark discourse and the GOAT talk with her. First of all, requiring titles for GOATS when recruiting, transfer portals, and only able to play 4 years, etc. are a thing makes little sense to me.

And GOAT or not, she took a team full of future Dentists, Optometrists, Occupational Therapists, Cancer Research scientists, Nurses, etc. to the National Championship game twice against multiple teams throughout the tournament laden with future WNBA players.

And by the way, I didn’t pull those professions out of thin air either. That is in fact professions that her actual teammates are going into now or will when they graduate.

I don’t care about the GOAT debate in any sport, but saying a player choked or must be trash because they didn’t win is really dumb. The runner ups this year for both men and women were solid teams that deeply relied on one star that had to go through some loaded teams to get to the Finals and then ran into absolute buzzsaws on historic runs.

The slight resistance was all that was needed. As soon as Edey had that stretch in the second half where he was tired and missed shots for a few minutes, UConn just steadily pulled away",Edey; UConn,Player; Team
7980,We did well but then let off the gas or got tired chasing and rebound in the second half and Loyer and Smith both went off.,Loyer; Smith,Player; Player
7981,"I mean Illinois was winning most of the 2nd game but then their perimeter players started knocking down contested 3s. Also, Illinois didn't have a big that could protect the rim from dribble penetration. 

But Purdue wasn't really even taking 3s. Seemed like the pressure got to some of the role players.",Illinois; Purdue,Team; Team
7982,"That's what I'm saying, do people seriously think Painter hadn't considered that they might do this? We just don't have an answer because we don't have the quality outside of Edey. UConn has a center that is probably the best possible counter to Edey 1-on-1 and Edey still got 37 and 10. If any other team sincerely tried this strategy he'd probably have had 50 on less shots. Hurley committed to the strategy and didn't waver when Edey was hot early.",Painter; Edey; UConn; Hurley,Coach; Player; Team; Coach
7983,"I found it impressive how comfortable the team was with drawing out the shot clock and taking good shots near the end without rushing them. Takes a lot of discipline for a team to maintain that sense of calm, and really contributed to the boa constrictor effect uconn seems to have",uconn,Team
7984,Brad Underwood said this at halftime and then we gave up a 30-0 run,Brad Underwood,Coach
7985,"I mean.. they got the double team almost every time, but then only one person was guarding the entire mid court area. The goal of a press is to get the guy being double teamed, to try to dribble out of it. Once again, they were too disciplined to make that mistake, and knew to pass it to the middle of the court, and to look for their guy filling in where the spy wasn’t. Every time they DID adjust their press, UConn would read and adjust their break to fill in behind the spy, then they wouldn’t try to force a dribble and just throw right to it. They were basically forcing Purdue into the same situation no matter what adjustments were made, and that’s the frustrating and beautiful part of it.",UConn; Purdue,Team; Team
7986,"Yeah. Same press, same press break, 5 times in a row. Not sure it super mattered because UConn didn’t want to take a shot early in the clock anyway, so giving away the transition opportunity didn’t change anything. But still, weird to see them stay in it when it’s such a clearly intentional choice to press and it was so clearly not affecting UConn at all.",UConn,Team
7987,Having 3-4 point guards on the court at any given time made this team essentially impossible to press.,,
7988,"The size advantage took out the press too. Purdue executed the press pretty well, but the UConn guards could just throw over the top of the double team. It was also 5 on 4 since Edey isn't mobile enough to do anything on the backside. One pass out of the double then a safe 60 foot pass into the front court knowing Edey will never get there.",Purdue; UConn; Edey,Team; Team; Player
7989,"I agree. It was fascinating to watch State and UCONN run essentially the same defensive game plans to stop Edey 48 hours apart. No disrespect to NCSU, but watching UCONN execute that same gameplan at such a higher level was just insane.",State; UCONN; Edey; NCSU,Team; Team; Player; Team
7990,Is it crazy to think that NC State would have done better against UConn than we did against Purdue? DJ Burns did a great job guarding Flip and our team is less reliant on one person performing well than Purdues is. Obviously against Purdue our perimeter shooting dried up and Horne was the only one that was hot but oh well.,NC State; UConn; Purdue; DJ Burns; Flip; Horne,Team; Team; Team; Player; Player; Player
7991,"Basically did that at the beginning of the game until he gassed himself. I kind of agree though, that was the only position on the floor we had an advantage. I don't really think there was a way for us to win unless Edey got Clingan in foul trouble. The refs let those guys play physical though (not complaining, just making the point that it was exhausting for Edey to get shots up on offense) so not much you can do.",Edey; Clingan,Player; Player
7992,I don’t know how Spencer only had what like 12 points? He was all over the place.,Spencer,Player
7993,"Yeah... I never really felt like UConn put it together offensively in the whole tournament. Credit better defense maybe? Although they did have a 4:1 assist to turnover ratio in the Final Four. That's nuts.

Defensively, UConn was on another level. Just perfect execution of each defensive game plan for the entire tournament. The only guy who really had a game against them was Sears. I'm not counting Edey because the game plan was never to try to stop him in the first place.",UConn; Sears; Edey,Team; Player; Player

If they can’t comprehend being aggressive basketball players and trying to take an opportunity to attack the rim in Clingan’s absence from the paint, then maybe the team truly was just Edey and some guys and a mediocre coach.

8031,"Clingan got beat by Edey, that’s for sure. But Edey had to work hard to do it. 280 is a lot to be pushing around. Against a smaller matchup I think he could post lower, didn’t have to jump as often or as high, and didn’t have to push as hard to get to his spots, so he actually could dominate the 1:1 for the full 40. Other teams doubled Edey because they had to. Clingan’s defense was the definition of making Edey work for it, and over 40 minutes that sustained effort wore him out.

Late in the first half, and about halfway through the second, when UConn finally managed to put together a couple stops and build a lead you can see Edey posting farther out from the basket and leaving those hooks short, and relying more on his right hand.

36% FG in the tourney 36% from 3. that's actually well below average.

Allow me to expand. In conference he was 90/210 FGM/FGA for 42%. Pretty mid.  Only thing he has going for him is assists and like I said, not that hard to dump it to Edey

EDIT: BRING THE DOWNVOTES BABY lol aww purdue lost so we have to coddle them. Idk who tf would say a guy averaging 12 points on 42% is anything but average, even more so when the defense gives up a lot of wide open shots due to Edey but keep them coming.

EDIT 2: Cuz I LOVE these casual Reddit fans and these annoying Purdue fans. Just watched the highlights to get an accurate count. Smith guarded Newton, who absolutely destroyed him, so bad they switched Heidi on him. Here are Smith's assist 1 to Renn on a broken play (when the ball got tipped in the back court and it was a scramble to get it) 1 oop to Edey early, 4 assists to Edey in the post who made a quick hook, 1 late game drop off to Edey in the post being guarded by Karaban when UCONN wasn't trying to play defense and then another late game oop to Edey. 7 of his 8 assists were to Edey with 2 of them coming in the last few minutes when UCONN wasn't even trying. So to recap, 5 of his 8 assists came from dumping the ball to Edey in the post and Edey quickly making a post move, 2 of those came late in the game when UCONN wasn't trying. Real stud out there.  KEEP THE DOWNVOTES COMING! He played absolutely trash just like everyone else on Purdue outside of Edey.

Honestly, once I saw that the first 20-ish points of Purdue were all in the paint, even though it was still tied, I just had that feeling it wasn't going to go well.

8117,"UConn made a bit of an adjustment, but they were struggling to guard the pick and roll in the first half. They kept letting Smith get downhill to his right hand. That was the four or five minute stretch when Edey kept getting roll passes (including that big dunk over Clingan).

I thought they maybe could have varied that pick and roll a little to try to generate switches. Edey just kind of camped out in the paint posting up. Yeah, he scored fairly efficiently, but he took away all their spacing. I know that's what he does, but he needed to be able to be more dynamic against UConn. 

I know Purdue was undersized at the guards and wings, but only getting up 7 threes IS a coaching issue. They could never get two guys on the ball. They could never generate any swing swing looks.

8125,"The Creighton game is an example of how it IS coaching to an extent. If your team can't get up more than 7 threes, that's on the coach. Creighton took almost 30 threes against UConn. How? They don't just post Kalkbrenner all game. He's out screening doing DHOs. Creighton was able to generate great spacing because they don't have a big sitting in the middle clogging the lane.

That's why the NBA doesn't play that way anymore. That big guy can score all the points he wants on seemingly good efficiency. But an Edey post up isn't as efficient as a cut to the basket that generates a dunk or a layup. It's also only moderately more efficient than the average Purdue three pointer.

Unless Painter thought that Edey was so good that he'd score 70% of the time he touched the ball in the post against Clingan, he needed to come up with some other way to spring his shooters and generate space.",Creighton; UConn; Kalkbrenner; Edey; Painter; Clingan,Team; Team; Player; Player; Coach; Player

Against Clingan, he was catching the ball further away, and while he was still making use of that strength and size, Clingan wasn't being moved.  So he'd catch the ball 8-10 feet out, the dunk was out of the question, and he couldn't move Clingan more than a foot or so, if at all.  When the game started and he was making hook shots like Jabbar from that far out, I was sure UConn was in big trouble.

I still honestly believe that even though UConn won the game, Edey deserved MOP.  I figured it would have to be something extraordinary.  And I thought he was exactly that. 

I went in thinking, ""Edey's great. But has he played a guy with the skill and size of Clingan in his career?""  And while I still think up until last night, he hadn't, it largely didn't matter.  He had to work harder than I've had to see him work before (and admittedly, I saw maybe one regular season game, the B1G tournament, and the NCAA, so small sample size).  But he did it.

Edey didn’t get doubled and they couldn’t generate threes. They ran some decent PnR action, but you could tell that they weren’t really comfortable with it, and UConn was able to blow it up most of the time by trapping it or hedging it. Their off ball movement was nonexistent, because they’re used to just going 4 out to make space for Edey to operate and make the double teamed have to cover more space.

I think a team that had practiced and actually implemented more diverse offensive sets would have been able to try different things, to get Edey some rest or generate threes a different way. But as a team their bag just wasn’t that deep. And that, like you said, is a coaching issue.",Edey; UConn,Player; Team

Which isn't to say Purdue couldn't find a way to get threes. There were some actions I think they could have, and should have, shot threes instead of hesitating or going for a drive to the paint.

UConn was the one team that, even when everybody was debating which was better between them and the other two, seemed like the best all-around team to me. They had all the advantages of both Houston and Purdue. Maybe not to the exact same extent, but close enough.

Basically would've needed crazy 3 point variance from someone as the best shot to beat them.  Just look at their 3 losses this year.  UConn shot under 20% from 3 vs Seton Hall and Creighton.

UConn made an adjustment, and they got away from it. Or maybe Johnson entering the game changed things. Edey got some good looks off the roll in the first half, including that dunk over Clingan. Then Johnson came in, and they went straight to iso post ups, which wasn't a bad idea really. Johnson picked up two quick fouls and went to the bench. Clingan came back in, and they didn't really go back to the pick and roll as much.

UConn was pretty clearly the better team, but I just think that modern offenses need to be able to generate at least 20 three point attempts per game.

Painter had made a comment during halftime too about how Purdue's guards were going to have to pump fake and dribble slide to help get cleaner looks. Gillis sort of did that and got stuffed.

The incentive to leave is lessened. I’m not saying UK isn’t a premier job or dissing it. The reality has just shifted to where if you’re in a power 5 conference and have won plus great resources you’re less likely to leave than in the past.

It's more us having three of the best shooters in Kentucky history and analytics showing that our best lineups were some of the least played because Cal was dead set on winning his way, which was going big with one or no shooters on the court. 

You cannot explain some of the lineups Cal played the past couple seasons and his refusal to allow certain players to play what was their more natural position. Especially when those ""basketball benny"" lineups would come in and dominate, get taken out and give up a run, only to have to be put back in and bring the team back into the game.

I don't really care how the takes gonna go over. He's not officiated fairly. 

He apparently can shoot 3's in practice, Painter just doesn't want him doing it in games. It's a possibility. He shoots well enough from the ft line too that it's not insane to think he could develop a 30% 3pt shot which is probably just enough to stick as a role player for a while.",Clingan,Player

17135,"Idk, whether or not those were fouls (some of them were, some of them weren’t) your poverty team put yourselves in a position where the refs mattered at all. If your poverty program was so good you should have been winning by enough for those things to not drastically affect the outcome of the game. 

Very funny to think Purdue had the refs on their side for every game except the championship. Maybe they forgot to pay the bill or something, seems like a massive oversight on Painter’s part. Or maybe, UConn’s such a good team that they can play defense *without* fouling (unlike Tennessee). Nahhh, must be that everyone has it out for poor ol’ rocky top.

Just so we’re clear on everything, lemme try to get your extremely complicated web of excuses straight: You were in a garbage bowl just like us but also weren’t as garbage as us. But we beat you, but only because you had a 1st year head coach and also because Purdue pays off the refs except in apparently a National Championship game for basketball, where Tennessee is also better than UCon and could have proven it if Purdue had forgotten to pay the ref bill that week.

You wanna add any more excuses? Maybe the sun was in your eyes? Mercury was in retrograde? You didn’t get a full 8 hrs of sleep the night before?

17499,"The B1G gets lots of 1 seeds but I think it has been pretty rare for a B1G team to secure the overall 1 seed over the last 20 years.    
    
I think it boils down to talent. The B1G recruits and develops well in aggregate but no one team has pooled and retained as much high level talent as some of the teams that have had multiple 1 overalls in that time(IIRC UK, UNC, Duke). The B1G has most of the largest enrollments and alumni bases in the country so maybe the NIL era can help some of the programs collect more talent idk but I think as long as teams kind of rotate in and out of winning and competing for the league title it will be hard to secure a 1 overall.           
           
UK, UNC, Duke don't really go in and out of contending for their respective league titles they're pretty much always at the top of the race every year and it's odd when they're not. There is no B1G equivalent to that lately. Some program is going to hire a young, dominant coach and they're enjoy that for a decade or two I hope it isn't UM but with the resources these programs have I think you just need the right coach to separate from the pack a bit and maybe build to a program that can get multiple overall 1 seeds over a decade. But I think the difference is no team has dominated the B1G and consistently finished top 3 over all that time which is I think how you develop and keep the UK/UNC/Duke recruiting edge over their peers given sufficient resources.

If people are talking about strictly 4 switching Mitchell for Stewart or even Mitchell for Flagg we are going to be in for the exact same problems.

People forget Mitchell shot 35% from 3 his freshman year. It's Isiah Evans and Kon Knueppel that were going to edge out Mitchell for minutes if he stayed. Both Knueppel and Evans should translate over to a little better offensively but they won't have the defense Mitchell had. They also don't have the rebounding or motor that Mitchell brought.

 It really doesn't matter how our F/Cs play out though if we don't get roach/proctor back or go fishing for a point guard that can actually run a half court offense. Caleb is not even close to being ready to run an offense and even if Proctor comes back he had a putrid assist to turnover ratio this year.

As a _thought_ yeah it's wild. But when you see what actually happened on the court, makes sense at times.

Also Mitchell shot 27.5% from 3pt, so not sure what you are on about. Both Power and Foster smoked him from that distance. So I guess you think Scheyer should have been starting them over Mitchell, and the real mistake this season was giving them less minutes in favor of his continued support of the underperforming Mitchell. Got it.

Edit: Also not only did he shoot a worse % from 3 (have you seen his shot?) he made 11 3pts and Foster made 28. It's a batshit dumb argument you're making that I don't agree with, but you don't seem to even have the stat sheet facts right. Did you watch games?

Also him shooting 62.3% from the FT line, defend that? You want that nonsense at the end of a tight game when he's already not playing well? Again, loved Mitchell, but unless you're his Mom I don't get why you are making these illogical arguments.

17638,"I head your concerns and theirs a lot of truth to your breakdown. I will say proctor is at his best playmaking wise when he has a lop threat. That’s why he was so successful playmaking as a freshmen him and lively had good chemistry. On paper him, Flagg and khaman is a better fit for his playmaking strengths. Also I disagree on your take on foster our offense was actually at its best when foster when in the starting 5. He has a very tight handle and the ball is on a string when he has it so he rarely turns it over and he is a very good floor spacer and underrated playmaker o think your severely underrating Caleb foster’s ability to be a PG that’s his natural position.

Flagg has yet to play a game in college but I can confidently tell you he has a better handle and shooter than Mitchell. Teams won’t sag off Flagg as badly as they did mark mitchell. 

Isaiah evans as a freshmen  won’t be the impactful defender mark mithcell is  but he will surprise some folks who aren’t aware how good his defense is.  Ppl think he is jus an explosive scorer but He is 6’7 with long arms and a competitive spirit. I’m more worried about how quickly he will pick up the off ball defensive concepts but he will be a very strong on ball defender 

Not to mention I’m not very worried at all about when defenses limit transition points because coach J’s offense simply doesn’t rely on transition points. In fact we don’t rlly play that fast that isn’t cosch J’s offense. We are very much a halfcourt offense wirh J sometimes I’m actually frustrated with the young athletic players we have that we don’t play a little faster",proctor;Flagg; foster; khaman; Mitchell; Caleb foster;Isaiah evans;mark mithcell; J,Player; Player; Player; Player; Player; Player; Player; Player; Coach

17640,"Sometimes you hit shots and sometimes you don’t. If you don’t have shooters then you never hit shots and your offense is predictable and easy to defend.

17641,"I watched most, ty.

Mitchell had a historic slump to start this season. Last year he shot 35% from 3 (yes, only 1.5 attempts per game, but @ 35% he’s still a threat). This season, before ND in early January he shot 1 for 22 from 3; from ND forward he shot 10 for 18 from 3.

He had a historic slump (remember Jack White’s?), but is otherwise should force a team to at least have a man near him on the arc as he shoots it above 35%, like I said.

And *obviously* Young has a better fg%, what are you talking about lmao…he’s a C whose range is 2 feet. It would be far more surprising if he didn’t have a better fg% than a shorter player that plays further from the basket. 

You’re being wholly disingenuous when you suggest I could think Power or Foster play bc they shoot better from 3 than Mitchell. Mitchell was a 4 that was good on the defensive end and could stretch the floor when we needed Kyle to be the 5 — no one else on the team offered that, and that’s the offense style this team was built to play.

17643,"Whether we play a half-court or a transition offense, Scheyer also needs to sit these guards down and make a real decision about who the point guard is and what his philosophy on ""the point guard position"" means.

It felt like all three guards were taking the ball up and playing off the ball at separate points during the game. The contrast vs. a team like Purdue (who had less skilled guards but a clear role which made the sytem better) was so jarring. 

I hope he says ""Proctor, here are the keys. You are the point guard. You should be A++ on dribble penetration and look for lobs.""  The same challenges (to me) existed with the guards as Mitchell.

Also regarding Caleb I wasn't knocking him in some of those other categories. Even when McCain began playing more consistent I still thought Caleb was our best shooter. His spacing will be massive for us and he is smart knowing defenses will be closing hard. He makes good decisions and can knock down mid range jumpers as well. I just didnt think I ever really saw him put the ball in rotation much or make plays for others. To his account he was also a freshman so I might be leaning too much on 1 year.

17722,Man what a disappointment. The only other time i've done a bigger 180 on my opinion of a player was Josiah Turner. I thought Boswell was the answer to the PG problem but he ended up being the same one dimensional PG that Kerr was.  If you look at all 3 NCAA tourney losses for Arizona the starting PG spot is the biggest weakness and in losses they have produced nearly the same game statistically. Boswell couldn't do much beside catch and shoot. He struggles with length and pressure defense and can't get to the rim. When he is on he can be a very good 3 point shooter but that wasn't very often by seasons end. Jaden Bradley is so very clearly the starting PG. He finally breaks the mold of a PG that can't do anything besides catch and shoot. Bradley was awesome in March and his advanced stats were super great off the bench. I'm a huge believer in Bradley being a great PG next year. Hope Kylan cleans up his of the court issues and finds success.,Josiah Turner; Boswell; Kerr; Arizona,Player; Player; Player; Team

Lots of rumors (I don't personally know how valid any of them are) that he was always out partying. 


That being said, he's literally an 18 year-old kid. How many 18 year-olds are always making the right decisions? How many 18 year-olds show consistency at the starting level for a P5 team? How many 18 year-olds can consistently hold their own every game going against 22-23 year-old men? The fact is this: if he gets his priorities straight and puts in the work, we've already seen the potential, he absolutely could be a great player.

So as much as the staff and a lot of us fans love Ballo, it's time for the future big men to take their spots. There's also the thought that Ballo could get big money for a year somewhere, and knowing he's a good dude with a big heart, I wouldn't be surprised if he wants to give something back to his family and community in Mali.


For Boswell, there's no guarantee he would start. It sounds like the staff sees Jaden Bradley as the starting point guard no matter what. Now we could run a 2 point guard system with Boswell as the starter, but there's also talk that Love might be seriously considering coming back, which would push Boswell to the bench.",Ballo,Player
17760,"I don't think it's near as concerning as it might look from the outside. It is just the realities of the transfer portal era. Neither Ballo nor Krivas was going to stick around here to be a back up next year, so Tommy had to choose between one more year of Ballo or potentially three more years of Krivas who was solid as a freshman and appears to have a much higher ceiling than Ballo. Tommy chose Krivas and I agree with that decision. People keep talking about Ballo leaving to ""get a bag"" but I think it just came down to playing time. Ballo isn't going to spend his 6th and final year of college backing up a Sophomore that took his starting spot when he could start at most other schools. And Tommy wasn't going to sacrifice a high ceiling 7'2 center who could be a four year guy to give Ballo one more year.

Boswell's decision comes from a similar place. Jaden Bradley looked better in the second half of the season and clearly Tommy must have indicated he would take the starting PG spot next year. Again, I agree with that decision. But, like Ballo, Boswell isn't going to waste his Junior year in a back up role when he could start at most other places, just like I don't think Bradley would have returned if he wasn't going to be the starter. It is a repeat of what happened last year when Tommy chose Boswell and Kriisa left for West Virginia. Basically, I think we were always going to lose one of Ballo or Krivas and one of Bradley or Boswell. I would have taken Krivas and Bradley and it appears that is the choice Tommy Lloyd made as well. I don't think these departures are any omens of internal upheaval or strife. I think this is just the way things work now.

His defense would become awful, he wouldn't move or penetrate on offense, and he would badly miss the long threes he would take.

The first University of Connecticut polo team was organized by Hal Vita in 1969. Polo has been an intercollegiate sport of men at UConn since 1969 and for women since 1976. Since its founding, the team has captured the men’s National Intercollegiate Polo Championships in 1972, 1973, and 1974 as well as the women’s National Intercollegiate Polo Championships in 1996, 1997, 1998, 2005, and 2022. The men’s teams of 1982 and 84 were Reserve National Intercollegiate Polo Champions. The women first came into national prominence in 1995, when they were Reserve National Champions. During the 1997-1998 season, the UConn Women were unbeaten in intercollegiate competition with a perfect 16 and 0 record! UConn’s men’s team had a record of nine wins and only two losses that same year, which was the best overall Intercollegiate polo record in the nation for 1997-98 season! In 2001, the program received a major upgrade with the construction of a new indoor arena. At 120 by 220 feet, UConn’s arena is one of the largest and newest in the country. The arena includes a heated lounge, dressing rooms, and an office.",UConn; University of Connecticut,Team; Team

17950,"I've heard this tidbit a few times, though never actually looked into where it's sourced, and honestly it's not clear what would constitute an ""official"" source of intercollegiate soccer being birthed in 1869.

[The website of US Soccer](https://www.ussoccer.com/history/timeline) defends the claim, briefly, that the Rutgers v. Princeton game belongs to the history of soccer in the States more than the history of gridiron in the states.

> Soccer was initiated as an organized college sport in the USA in the years following the Civil War. Princeton and Rutgers Universities engaged in the first intercollegiate soccer match Nov. 6, 1876, in New Brunswick, N.J. Rutgers won the match 6-4. **The game was more similar to both rugby and soccer than gridiron football.**

The similarities to both rugby, and the similarities to soccer both make it fair to call a game in the history of intercollegiate soccer and gridiron football, but it's _much_ less of a stretch to consider it a soccer match than to consider it a gridiron match — it's just a matter that the rules of what would develop into the ""English game"" were still in flux this early in the history of the football codes.",Princeton; Rutgers,Team; Team
